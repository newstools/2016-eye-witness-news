It has been said that you campaign in poetry and govern in prose.US president-elect Donald Trump campaigned with a knuckle sandwich and is moving towards governing with blankety-blank.He divided supporters and opponents between delight and horror at what he did on the hustings. They are united now in complete ignorance about what on earth he is doing.My favourite writer on Africa Michaela Wrong commented that Trump is teaching Americans the real meaning of the devil is in the detail.What a painful lesson it will be from someone not merely economical with the truth, but often a total stranger to it.Trump says one thing on camera in the morning and denies any knowledge of it after lunch.Small wonder the policy watchers, who have made a career of knowing within days whom an approaching president might appoint and what policies his administration might implement, remain completely in the dark.Just yesterday he demolished two cornerstones of his campaign: bringing crooked Hillary to justice via a special prosecutor and blocking US payments to fighting the Chinese hoax of climate change.The Donald does not have to bother telling us his threats were just locker room talk or marketing because he has dozens of people clamouring for the jobs he has in his favour assuring us it is no big deal.What hope then of even guessing what a Trump administration plans to do about Africa?Our continent did not feature in the campaign. Foreign policy seldom does.Since the 19602, Africa has managed to elbow its way onto the US domestic agenda.I have heard no convincing argument that Africa will not slide down the priority list of the Trump administration.For starters, there is no payback from The Donald for any African leader because as far as can be ascertained they opposed him to a man - or woman, in the case of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president who lamented Hillary Clinton s defeat.Whoever he appoints as his undersecretary of state for Africa will have his or her work cut out explaining to him the concept of the African diaspora, of which the US is a major component.Africans are expecting a Trump administration to be intolerant and disinterested in Africa where it impinges on the hardline American domestic interest.But will it go further than this?Will there be a decline in US investment in Africa?What will become of the 16-year-old African Growth and Opportunity Act that gives African products favoured access to US markets?Could it go the same way as other trade deals the protectionist Trump is promising to tear up?So African analysts are reduced to putting a brave face on what might happen if things go as badly as currently expected.If there is a decline in US aid, it will help break the cycle of dependence.If access to US markets is curtailed, it will force Africa to work at improving intra-African trade.And if Africa is repelled by the US, it would mean the continent is driven even closer to China.Jean-Jacques Cornish is an Africa correspondent at Eyewitness News.
