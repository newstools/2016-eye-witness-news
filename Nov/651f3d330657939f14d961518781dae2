The Eskom CEO says the allegations levelled against him &amp; Eskom in the &#8216;State of Capture&#8217; report are unfounded. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO Brian Molefe says the allegations levelled against him and the power utility in the State of Capture report are unfounded.During a briefing today, Molefe emphasised he would have explained the utility's deal with Tegeta if former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had given him the opportunity to do so.#Eskom Molefe says there&#39;s no basis for allegations, enquiry will take place but in the meantime his children will be taunted at school GN#Eskom Molefe makes light of cell phone evidence placing him at Gupta residence &quot;there&#39;s a shebeen there in that area&quot; GNThe report has revealed that Molefe was in regular contact with the Gupta family and visited their Saxonwold home last year, during the acquisition of the Optimum coal mine by the Gupta-owned Tegeta firm.Part of the controversy around the deal revolves around a pre-payment of more than R600 million that Eskom had approved for coal from the company.Molefe says the pre-payment of R600 million has been settled, and the company delivered during a time when Eskom was desperate for coal and doing everything it could to prevent load shedding.#Eskom Powerful statement from Molefe he takes responsibility for Tegeta deal, maintains it was above board, becomes tearful defending EskomHe says he disagreed with Glencore's request to increase coal prices, and takes responsibility for that decision.Molefe says he supplied Madonsela with a number of documents but he was never called to her office to explain the deal that was made with Tegeta. I do not think that the basis of what she (Thuli Madonsela) says about Eskom and myself is correct. A special briefing will be held on Friday to deal with more aspects of the report.LISTEN: Former ConCourt judge weighs in on state capture report State Capture Report 2016 by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited Zamangwane Shange)
