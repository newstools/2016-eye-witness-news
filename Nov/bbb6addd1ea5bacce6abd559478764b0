The national department and Rand Water have no authority to enforce bylaws. It is the responsibility of the municipality to have bylaws and enforce those bylaws, including the penalties that they introduce.

She says the Vaal Dam is currently at 26% of usable water, but should it reach 25%, it may affect the dam infrastructure.Mokonyane, however, adds that there are numerous mega projects to address the problem. The uneven ability by our municipalities in some of the provinces to deal with the provision of water to the end user, where you may find that there is a community that has been without water for the past two weeks and yet there could have been interventions by the municipality.
