Chief Justice Mogoeng dismissed Jacobus Kruger&#8217;s submissions this morning that he&#8217;s a pastor and has black friends. JOHANNESBURG The Constitutional Court has ruled that the South African Revenue Service (Sars) was justified in firing an official for making racist remarks, setting aside his reinstatement.Jacobus Kruger, a former Sars officer based at OR Tambo International Airport, went on a racist outburst calling his boss the k-word in 2007. At a disciplinary hearing, Kruger blamed stress for his comments and was suspended. But then Sars Commissioner Pravin Gordhan was dissatisfied and immediately fired him.Kruger took his dismissal to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and won. Sars lost its subsequent appeals in the Labour Court before arguing the case at the Constitutional Court in August.Today, the court ruled that Kruger being reinstated is unreasonable and must be set aside.The court said Sars was justified in firing Kruger, maintaining that the revenue service cannot be expected to retain an employee it has lost faith and confidence in.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says this kind of conduct must be met with a firm response if the country ever hopes to remove racism.(Edited by Tamsin Wort)
