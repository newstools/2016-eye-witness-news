The multi-party committee established to carry out the inquiry met for the first time on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG - Parliament's inquiry into the fitness of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board to hold office is going ahead in spite of the resignations of two more board members.The multi-party committee, established to carry out the inquiry, met for the first time on Tuesday, to map out its programme and decide on who to call as witnesses.The two resignations mean board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe is the sole remaining non-executive director.But there's a question mark over what will happen if Maguvhe also resigns before hearings get under way at the end of this month.Newly elected chairperson of the committee, ANC MP Vincent Smith, says it is duty bound to continue with the inquiry as long as Maguvhe remains in place. If by the 29 November, there is still, even if it s one individual,the process will continue. If by the 29th there are no more individuals, those that serve as non-executive directors, we will have to get a directive from those that have given us the task, because this ad hoc committee is but a sub-committee of the House. Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and SABC staff are among those on the draft witness list.The committee intends concluding its hearings before Parliament goes into recess on 9 December.It must report back to the National Assembly by the end of February next year.(Edited by Neo Koza)
