JOHANNESBURG With some South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) journalists fearing for their lives after speaking out, Communications Minister Faith Muthambi says anyone who tries to threaten the safety of a South African should be held accountable.Muthambi has responded to the alleged attacks on the so called SABC 8, who have taken the public broadcaster to court over its controversial editorial policies.It s understood the journalists and the lawyers representing them have been receiving threatening messages in an attempt to coerce them to drop the charges.The minister has previously accused the media of sensationalizing the censorship issue. She says the use of violent threats and intimidation should not be tolerated. It s a pity that any South African would have to go through this kind of violence. No one has the right to threaten or disrupt the movement of any person.
