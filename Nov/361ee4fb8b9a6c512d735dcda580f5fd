The bill makes it a criminal act to intentionally disclose false information. CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly has passed draft legislation aimed at giving more protection to people who blow the whistle on corruption or other wrongdoing.But the Protected Disclosures Amendment Bill has also come under opposition fire.The bill makes it a criminal act to intentionally disclose false information.Opposition parties say this clause will have a chilling effect and could discourage whistleblowers from coming forward.The Economic Freedom Fighters s Sam Matiase says: The bill is another attempt by the African National Congress government to bring back, through the back door, its failed bid to introduce the Protection of State Information Bill, otherwise called the secrecy bill. The so-called secrecy bill was passed three years ago but has not been signed into law by President Jacob Zuma.The Democratic Alliance s Werner Horn says: We will be placing a duty on prospective whistleblowers to first investigate and verify whether the information they have, and which they believe could point to wrongdoing, is in fact true, before blowing the whistle. But Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffery says the state will have to prove a whistleblower disclosed the information knowing it to be false, with the intention of causing harm, and actually causing harm.The bill will now go before the National Council of Provinces for concurrence.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
