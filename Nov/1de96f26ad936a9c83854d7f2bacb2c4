The 27m wide, 30m long and 15m deep sinkhole was repaired in just a week. A section of road in the centre of the Japanese city of Fukuoka, Japan, has reopened just days after a sinkhole opened up outside a busy railway station and threatened to topple nearby buildings.The huge sinkhole sucked in a four-lane urban boulevard, eroding soil and exposing underground steel and pipes.Workers toiled around the clock and had practically filled in the section of road.Within a few days, the hole was filled in with a mixture of cement and sand.It was 27 metres wide, 30 metres long and 15 metres deep. The incident caused power cuts and disrupted phone signals, and gas and water supplies, but there were no reports of injuries.Officials believe the sinkhole was caused by nearby underground construction.Meanwhile, people had nothing but praise for the workers who fixed the hole.
