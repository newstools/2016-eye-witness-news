The Constitutional Court said that Sars was justified in firing Jacobus Kruger after he called his superior the k-word. JOHANNESBURG - A scathing Constitutional Court ruling says the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) should not have reinstated a Sars employee after he used the k-word during an argument with his boss.Jacobus Kruger, a former Sars officer based at OR Tambo International Airport, went on a racist outburst calling his boss the k-word in 2007 and was subsequently suspended.The then Sars head Pravin Gordhan was dissatisfied with the sanction and immediately fired Kruger.Since 2007, Kruger has been trying to get his job back after he called his superior the k-word.He took the matter to the CCMA and won but Sars continued to fight back by appealing the order and then finally arguing its case in the Constitutional Court this year.Today, the court placed emphasis on the use of the k-word, saying this kind of racist conduct requires a very firm and unapologetic response from the courts, particularly the highest courts. It found that Sars was justified to fire Kruger as it could not be expected to retain an employee it had lost faith in.Sars Sandile Memela said: Sars had chosen to take a principled stand on this matter after various unsuccessful challenges at the CCMA, Labour Court and the Labour Appeal Court until we escalated it to the Constitutional Court. So we welcome it as a victory for anti-racism. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says the use of this word, 13 years into democracy bears testimony to the fact that there are many bridges yet to be crossed.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
