The board Board says new regulations could see outlets paying up to 100 percent more for liquor licenses. JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng Liquor Board says new regulations could see outlets and restaurants paying up to 100 percent more to retain their liquor licenses.The board appeared before the standing committee on public accounts at the Gauteng Provincial Legislature on Thursday to answer members questions about the entity.It says its implemented stricter regulations for those applying for a liquor license, adding that the national board will soon be implementing the 500 metre radius rule currently in Gauteng, nationally. This ensures that no liquor selling or serving outlet can be placed within 500 metres of a school or place of worship.Deputy Director General for Business Regulation and Governance, Advocate Peter Holl, says while liquor outlets are critical of the proposed higher license rates, the provincial liquor board has not increased the rates since 2003. To renew a restaurant license is R3,000. We have increased that now to R6,000. It sounds that it s a 100 percent increase; but if you take the period into consideration, for the past 13 years it has never been increased. If we had increased over the years it would have come to the same amount that we came to now. He says the additional funding will also go into cracking down on none complying outlets.Holl says the board has a responsibility to curb the mushrooming of liquor outlets, which may lead to increased alcohol abuse.(Edied by Masechaba Sefularo)
