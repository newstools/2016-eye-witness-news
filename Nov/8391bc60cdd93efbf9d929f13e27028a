We re working together with the police. They will assist us in monitoring and managing the situation, and we also have additional security on those campuses and they will also be making sure there s security around the buses and at the Tshwane Events Centre. Last week, students said they have not had enough time to prepare due to the Fees Must Fall protest disruptions.Students embarked on a violent protest calling for management to postpone exams to January.Student leader Thapelo Mhlongo said their campus is no longer conducive for learning and they are therefore calling for exam postponement. The environment is no longer conducive and the majority of students are no longer interested in writing, that is why most of them are fighting; they want to write their exams in January because they feel now it s no longer easy for them to study.
