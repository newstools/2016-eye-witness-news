CAPE TOWN - The brother of a man who died in police custody says he intends taking action, as he believes his arrest was unlawful.Nadeem Khan was arrested in Rondebosch last week on suspicion of selling a stolen cellphone.He was declared dead on arrival at the local police station.His family says he was trying to sell his own phone when he was taken into custody.The cause of Khan's death has not yet been determined.But his brother, Amien Khan, says a post-mortem has shown no definitive evidence that he may have been assaulted. Being a medical personnel myself we can only surmise the possible cause. I think there was negligence and a wrongful arrest from the police's side. Khan says the father of two suffered from bipolar disorder and was on treatment. The whole incident caused emotional stress and that actually has a trigger to cause the sympathetic arousal to increase adrenal secretion, which caused him to have hyperventilation and pain on the heart. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating the incident.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
