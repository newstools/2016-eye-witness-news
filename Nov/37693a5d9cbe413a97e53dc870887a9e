The report revealed that Eskom helped Gupta-owned company Tegeta take over Optimum mine by agreeing to a R600 million pre-payment for coal. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has disputed former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's findings in the State of capture report, saying that all transactions complied with the utility's procurement policies. Eskom is holding a special briefing today to present a number of facts that it says were not included in Madonsela's report. The report revealed that Eskom helped Gupta-owned company Tegeta take over Optimum mine by agreeing to a R600 million pre-payment for coal. Dr Pat Naidoo went through a presentation today, showing Eskom's version of the controversial deal made with Tegeta. Naidoo reiterated what CEO Brian Molefe said yesterday - that the deal was above board, complied with Eskom's procurement policy and helped the utility avoid load shedding during a time when it desperately needed quality coal. Naidoo says all this information was provided to the Public Protector. Eskom will consider taking the report on review.
