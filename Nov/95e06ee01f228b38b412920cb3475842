Students say they now fear for their own safety after witnessing &amp; hearing about Kelvin Baloyi&#8217;s killing. JOHANNESBURG Students living at a private residence in the Johannesburg CBD, where a University of Johannesburg student was shot and killed, say they can no longer bear living in the building and are now packing their bags and going back home.Twenty-one-year-old Kevin Baloyi was killed, allegedly by a security guard, on Saturday morning after a year-end party on the premises. Students say building management called in extra security on Friday night because of a party, but things allegedly got out of hand when the guards wouldn t let them continue partying on the 14th floor. Students say they now fear for their own safety after witnessing and hearing about Baloyi s murder on the premises. Student Eddie Majola says he was standing right next to Baloyi when the shots were fired and is traumatised by what he witnessed. The building is a bit quiet now, all of a sudden I imagine things, I picture things. I just don t want to be alone anymore, so I felt I was better if I stayed at home. Another student, Comfort Mabelane, says she doesn t understand why the man was allowed on the premises with a firearm. The rules of the building say no weapons are allowed in our building. How could they let an armed guard come into a student residence? Baloyi was doing his first year at UJ, studying towards a bachelor degree in computer science.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
