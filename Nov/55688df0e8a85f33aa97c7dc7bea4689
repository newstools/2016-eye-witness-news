The civil society group says details of the report will eventually be made public but not before thousands of rands are wasted to stop its release. JOHANNESBURG - Civil society group Save South Africa says the state capture report will inevitably be released, but not before hundreds of thousands of rand are wasted during attempts by two ministers and President Jacob Zuma to halt its publication.Zuma, along with Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, have applied for an urgent court interdict to stop the release of the report.However, the Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters, United Democratic Movement, Congress of the People and former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor have opposed the application.Zuma, Van Rooyen and Zwane claim the state capture report was rushed and they weren't given an opportunity to properly respond to allegations. They say the controversial document should not be released.But more details emerged over the weekend implicating van Rooyen. The Sunday Times reported that he was at the controversial Gupta family's home seven days in a row before his brief appointment as Finance Minister in December.Van Rooyen and Zwane have both denied that their appointments were influenced by anyone other than the president.Save South Africa's Mark Heywood says the details of the report will be made public. The fact that the president and Des van Rooyen are fighting tooth and nail, a battle which I can tell you they will lose, it will come out. Once it comes out we ll have a clearer picture of what s been going on in this country. Zuma's legal team will be seeking a postponement today.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
