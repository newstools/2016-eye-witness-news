The party&#8217;s secretary general Gwede Mantashe says the National Prosecuting Authority should not get involved in political fights. JOHANNESBURG Gwede Mantashe, the African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General, says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must be politically neutral.On Monday, NPA head advocate Shaun Abrahams announced he was withdrawing the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Mantashe says the NPA should not get involved in political fights. He adds that politicians and parties should also avoid influencing the prosecuting authority.The NPA has admitted that Abrahams saw President Jacob Zuma the day before he charged Gordhan but says they didn't discuss this case.The ANC says Zuma must engage with the NPA to ensure that the situation around Gordhan doesn't happen again.Meanwhile, former ANC treasurer general Mathews Phosa says that Abrahams should have stepped down yesterday.Phosa has approached the General Council of the Bar with a request to probe the NPA head's conduct.He says Abrahams should have stepped down immediately after his announcement yesterday. At the end of his press conference, he should have stepped down. He should have said that under the circumstances, he was stepping down. The country lost billions of rand because of stupid decisions. At the same time, ANC Gauteng chairperson Paul Mashatile says the party is concerned about the motive behind the charges. We believe that the NPA must only go to court to charge a citizen when they have a solid case. In this case, it appears this was not the case, so it really worries us on what the real motive was.
