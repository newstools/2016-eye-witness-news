Workers at Lonmin, Anglo American Platinum &amp; Impala Platinum will receive an annual wage increase of R1,000 for the next 3 years. JOHANNESBURG Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) President Joseph Mathunjwa says while members of the mining union have welcome a three-year wage agreement with the country's largest platinum producers, a war has to be won against retrenchments.The union officially signed the multi-year deal in Sandton on Monday, in which all parties agreed to a R1,000 basic salary increase for employees.This means workers at Lonmin, Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum will receive the hike annually for the next three years.Mathunjwa has raised concerns over the safety of mineworkers and job losses. That is the war we have to declare against health and safety, as we are losing many of our comrades in this mining sector. Lonmin CEO Bennetor Magara says he s pleased all parties were able to reach an agreement. I know the journey we have travelled together that started with many challenges. It is really the maturity I see on how we engage and respect each other, which I believe is a sign of what Africa can do. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
