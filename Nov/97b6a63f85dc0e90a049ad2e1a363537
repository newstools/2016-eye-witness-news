CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo says renovations to Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital will decrease the waiting time for prisoners.Mbombo opened the newly refurbished historic Main Administration Building today as part of the hospital s 125-year anniversary celebrations.The facility was the first psychiatric hospital to be established in the Western Cape more than a century ago.Mbombo says the upgrades to the facility will be in two phases. The building also accommodates admission and families of the patients who are coming in for assessments will be able to move around especially in the admission side of it. Mbombo says the new building will help alleviate the burden on courts where awaiting trial prisoners may require mental assessments. These upgrades we have will decrease waiting time for awaiting trial prisoners who require these kind of forensic psychiatry evaluations. Also, staff s safety and patient security is included in the building, although it is 125 years it might be strong but it needed a lot of face lifting. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
