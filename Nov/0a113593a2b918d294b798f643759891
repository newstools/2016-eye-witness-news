Robert Mugabe was referring to the political mauling Jacob Zuma has been getting in his home country. HARARE - President Robert Mugabe has told President Jacob Zuma he s pleased to see his counterpart is still in one piece. Zuma and Mugabe are today chairing a forum in Harare that's meant to strengthen economic and political ties between the two neighbours, who both face rising discontent at home.The forum is being held just a day after the damning state capture report was released, implicating the president, Cabinet ministers and state-owned entities in corruption.Mugabe says he and Zuma need each other now more than ever. However, Mugabe let it slip that a forum of business representatives from both countries wasn t going to be part of today s deliberations. That will be a disappointment for Zimbabwe, which was pinning its hopes on new investment and trade leads.Despite bond notes and forecasts of negative economic growth, Mugabe did assure South African businesses that any investments they made would be safe in Zimbabwe.
