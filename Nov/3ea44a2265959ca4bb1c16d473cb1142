Herman Mashaba tweeted that a friend of his was knocked down by Jacob Zuma&#8217;s blue lights brigade. CAPE TOWN - City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says the Presidency should provide details of a presidential protection unit vehicle that allegedly killed a pedestrian on Friday. Mashaba tweeted earlier that a friend of his was knocked down by President Jacob Zuma s blue lights brigade. It s actually deeply worrying and painful to the family for the Presidency to deny this particular matter. I think it would really help the Presidency if they can provide details of the car that killed Solly on Friday. I have just received the terrible news that President Zuma&#39;s blue lights brigades killed a friend Solly Moutlana in Pretoria yesterdayThe SAPS have the legal responsibility to urgently release vehicle involved in accidents,moreover fatal onesIn a statement released earlier today, Presidential spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga says they ve been informed of a pedestrian being killed by a car driven by a police officer in Pretoria but that the incident did not involve a convoy of President Zuma. It creates an impression that a SAPS convoy transporting President Zuma caused this painful loss of life, which is totally untrue and misleading. On Friday he was in East London to participate in a National Council of Provinces event. Ngqulunga says they've been informed that police are investigating after a pedestrian was knocked down by a car driven by a police officer in Pretoria.The statement further adds that, the Presidency on enquiry, has been informed that police are investigating a case involving the knocking of a pedestrian by a car driven by a police officer in Pretoria. It says it extends heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased on this tragic loss.
