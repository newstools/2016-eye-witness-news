A complaint was lodged with the Public Protector's office four years ago over allegations that Sanral was involved in irregular tenders. CAPE TOWN Parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts has expressed unhappiness that the Public Protector s office has not concluded a probe into Gauteng e-tolls.This emerged during a Sanral briefing in national legislature on Tuesday on irregular, wasteful and fruitless expenditure. A complaint was lodged with the Chapter Nine institution four years ago following allegations that the state entity was involved in irregular tenders relating to e-tolls.Scopa chairperson Themba Godi says former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has ignored the complaint. You ve no indication on whether there s progress or not. I find that to be completely unacceptable after more than a year sending letters, numerous phone calls and still we do not know whether there s progress or not. Transport Minister Dipuo Peters says there was a meeting scheduled with Madonsela which the Cabinet member could not attend. Thereafter it was just not possible for us to have a meeting with the Public Protector up to the stage, including the fact that I wrote to her before she left to saying we want to know what is happening and instead I received a letter that said I owe her a report.
