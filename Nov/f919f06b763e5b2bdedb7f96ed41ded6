Judge Dunstan Mlambo said there were insufficient grounds for an urgent application to force Jacob Zuma to suspend Shaun Abrahams. JOHANNESBURG - Civic rights groups Freedom Under Law (FUL) and the Helen Suzman Foundation say their application to have NPA head Shaun Abrahams suspended was not premature but will explore their options going forward.Judge Dunstan Mlambo has ruled that there were insufficient grounds for an urgent application to force President Jacob Zuma to suspend Abrahams.The groups argued that Abrahams as well as advocates Torie Pretorius and Sibongile Mzinyathi must be suspended immediately in order to regain the NPA s integrity.Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation believe that Abrahams and the other two prosecutors should be suspended for the way they handled the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.On Thursday arguments were heard on the urgency of their application but the full bench of judges ruled that the matter is not urgent.They feel that President Zuma acted reasonably and had considered suspending Abrahams and the other two others when he asked them to provide reasons why they should not be suspended.The Helen Suzman Foundation s Francis Antoine said: I don t think we used the courts improperly. The judges have a view and we respect their view but I don t think the matter is over at this level. The groups will now consult their lawyers to decide on a way forward.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
