We are appealing that the matter be considered. We should be patient. Wait and see what happens. Fee increases for next year have been capped at eight percent, while students from households earning up to R600,000 a year will pay no increase.The interim report suggests that state-funded students should pay back all, or some of the money once they start earning.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
