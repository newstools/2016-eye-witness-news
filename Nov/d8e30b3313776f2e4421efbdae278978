The ANC will announce President Jacob Zuma's fate later today when it holds a media briefing on the outcome of its NEC meeting. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) will announce President Jacob Zuma's fate later on Tuesday when it holds a media briefing on the outcome of its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.The NEC, which was meant to conclude its meeting on Sunday, extended it to Monday where it sat till late in the evening.The extension came as a motion of no confidence against the president was tabled by Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom.The ANC was initially scheduled to brief the media on the outcome of the NEC meeting on Monday night but it moved that briefing to later on Tuesday.It's understood that NEC members at the meeting where given an opportunity to state their case on whether they want Zuma to resign or not.Zuma had to rush out of the meeting which has been described by some NEC members as tense, to host his Ugandan Counterpart Yoweri Museveni in Pretoria, and rushed back to continue with the meeting.This was unprecedented as Zuma spent less than two hours with Museveni and according to his office only discussed one issue, and didn't review bilateral cooperation between the two countries, as well as the latest regional political and security developments on the continent - as was initially planned.It seems the ANC president is going nowhere.It's understood the motion of no confidence tabled against him was shot down by Zuma's supporters in the meeting.Eyewitness News has learnt that Hanekom, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, his deputy Joe Phaahla, Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi, Gauteng ANC chair Paul Mashatile, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu, acting Western Cape ANC chair Khaya Magaxa and Member of Parliament Mathole Motshekga were leading the motion of no confidence against Zuma.It's understood the group mentioned the Nkandla Constitutional Court judgment, corruption charges against the president, spy tapes and the state capture report, saying they cost the party at the polls.But Zuma's supporters fired back saying there was no scientific evidence that the issues were the cause of the party's electoral decline.The supporters do admit though that the motion against Zuma came as a big surprise.It's also understood that in his closing remarks the president expressed his disappointment at those who 'plotted against' him.He apparently told the gathering he has been accused of many things since 2002 and that he will not step down voluntarily as he would be handing himself to the enemy.(Edited by Neo Koza)
