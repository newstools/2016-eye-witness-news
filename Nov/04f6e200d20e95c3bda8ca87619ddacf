The National Assembly failed to pass a crucial budget bill on two occasions because there weren&#8217;t enough MPs in the house. JOHANNESBURG - The National Treasury says while Parliament is still scheduled to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill by the end of the year, if the legislation is not passed, it will mean government departments will not be able to get the money that has been allocated to them.Earlier this week the African National Congress failed to pass the bill after it could not get enough of its Members of Parliament (MPs) to the National Assembly to form a quorum when opposition parties removed their MPs from the chamber. The National Treasury says adjustments in the money allocations in this legislation are critical for the continued provision of services by several government institutions.It says that any delays to spending by departments could hamper service delivery and that departments are not able to spend funds properly by the end of the current financial year.But the Treasury also says the bills are on track to be passed by the end of this year.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
