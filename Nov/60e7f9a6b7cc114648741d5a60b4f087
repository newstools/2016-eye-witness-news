CAPE TOWN - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has been put in her place after threatening to walk out of a meeting of Parliament s finance watchdog, Scopa.Motshekga and top department officials appeared before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) to account for R2 billion in irregular expenditure, nearly R600 million of which was incurred during the past financial year.Motshekga interrupted proceedings when the meeting began with tough questions aimed directly at her director-general Mathanzima Mweli. The DG will present the report. If you will allow me to really give context, the DG will give you a report. Unless you are saying I shouldn t be here, then I shall leave. African National Congress member of Parliament Nyami Booi told her she could not dictate to Parliament. Whatever she says, the decision lies with Parliament on how we make decisions.
