We have spoken to the minister of defence and she knew nothing about it, although the commander did say that the instruction came from Pretoria. She has committed to conducting an urgent investigation, but it was a horrible situation to be in. Many municipal officials were traumatised. Meanwhile, the department's Xolani Mabanga says the details of the incident needs to be verified before officials intervene. We are investigating whether the South African National Defence Force members were armed or equipped with weapons that were fully loaded. We just have to verify the facts. We know that the South African National Defence Force usually has weapons with them. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
