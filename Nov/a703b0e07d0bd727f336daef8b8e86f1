Julian Redelinghuys says he still doesn't have full use of his arm following the injury. JOHANNESBURG - Julian Redelinghuys has told EWNSport he still doesn't have full use of his arm after suffering a neck dislocation in the Lions' loss to the Cheetahs in the Currie Cup semi-finals.He says it's difficult to determine when he will be ready to play rugby again: It's nerves, so my one arm is still numb, I can't lift it well. It's getting better every day, but they can't tell how a nerve will recover because it differs from person to person. Redelinghuys says the support he received was incredible: The messages and everyone phoning, it was very overwhelming, I can't thank everyone enough. There were even people I didn't know walking into my hospital room to pray for me. We're very grateful to everyone. The Springboks kick off their end of year tour with a match against the Barbarians this Saturday.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
