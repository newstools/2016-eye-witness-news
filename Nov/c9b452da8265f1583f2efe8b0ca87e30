Some ANC stalwarts say they&#8217;re deeply saddened about the current state of the party and have requested a meeting with the president. JOHANNESBURG - Former president Thabo Mbeki has written to President Jacob Zuma expressing concerns about the manner in which the African National Congress (ANC) has responded to growing dissatisfaction with him, particularly by the veterans.Some ANC stalwarts say they re deeply saddened about the current state of the party and have requested a meeting with the president to discuss the direction in which the country is headed.Ahmed Kathrada, Frank Chikane and Dennis Goldberg are just some of the 101 veterans who have publicly spoken out against the current leadership of the ANC.Mbeki wrote to Zuma on Tuesday advising him not to make light of the concerns of the veterans which he says is a sentiment shared by many more.In the letter addressed to President Zuma, Mbeki explains that he was out of the country when the group of ANC veterans issued their media statement about their interaction with ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe, but it was Mantashe's response which had him concerned.He says Mantashe's response focused on administrative and structural internal processes of the movement and appears to show a lack of awareness for the urgency the signatories feel.Mbeki says it would appear what the veterans are asking for is something simple and that the ANC should take the necessary measures as the governing party to live up to its solemn obligation: to serve the people of South Africa.The veterans say they have attempted to meet Zuma but he has not availed himself to listen to their issues.Mbeki's spokesperson Mukoni Ratshitanga confirmed that the letter was sent to Luthuli House for Zuma but does not know whether the president has received it yet.To read the full letter from Mbeki click here.
