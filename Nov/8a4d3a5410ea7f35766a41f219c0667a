The suspended ANC chair will know in 14 days whether the NPA will proceed with criminal charges against him. CAPE TOWN Suspended African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape Chairperson Marius Fransman could know after two weeks whether or not the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will proceed with criminal charges against him.The charges relate to sexual assault allegations made by a woman he had hired to work as his personal assistant.The NPA says it expects the investigating officer s work to be concluded in two week's time.Officials will then determine whether there is sufficient evidence to formally charge Fransman.Northern Cape NPA spokesperson Phaladi Shuping says, The investigating officer has promised that by the end of next week, all the investigations will have been completed. Last week, the ANC s National Disciplinary Committee suspended Fransman for five years for bringing the party into disrepute.The committee found Fransman guilty of abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from his former assistant Wynand and also of making statements which brought the ruling party into disrepute.The ANC released a statement saying Fransman showed no political understanding of one of the fundamental objectives of the ANC relating to the support for and advancement of women s emancipation .It went on to say there was no room in the party for leaders and members, irrespective of position or seniority, who show scant regard for the values and objectives of the party.Meanwhile, Fransman claims Louisa Wynand s complaint is part of a politically engineered plot to get rid of him.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
