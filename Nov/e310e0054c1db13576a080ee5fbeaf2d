After appearing in the Newcastle Magistrates Court last week, the EFF leader made this comment: We are not calling for the slaughter of white people at least for now. Now Malema says he never said that white people must be slaughtered but that if he wanted to make a call along these lines he would have done it. We are not promoting violence, but I can t guarantee the future. I m not a prophet. I am talking now, we are not carrying weapons. He says his polite plea to white people is for them to return the land, saying if they don t he can t guarantee what will happen next.
