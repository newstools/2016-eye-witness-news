According to reports, the EFF applied to have the vote included on the order paper for Tuesday&#8217;s sitting. CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly has confirmed the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has lodged an urgent application for a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. According to reports the EFF applied to have the vote included on the order paper for Tuesday s sitting. The Speaker s office has indicated the matter is being decided on as Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli will handle proceedings.Earlier in November, African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament overwhelmingly voted against a motion of no confidence in Zuma in Parliament.The Democratic Alliance (DA) launched the motion following the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's explosive State of Capture report which revealed how the Gupta family played a key role in Cabinet appointments, made under-handed deals to pursue business interests and how the president failed to take action.Opposition parties debated the motion, with proceedings becoming heated at times.DA leader Mmusi Maimane called on ANC MPs vote against their leader. This one man who holds us back from fulfilling the dreams of our people, I think we all know who that man is because many of you have been speaking out against him. We agree with [Mathole] Motshekga who said the ANC leadership must choose between the president on one hand and the ANC and the people of South Africa on the hand. The EFF s Floyd Shivambu wanted a secret ballot. We need to introduce a secret ballot because it is logical. We voted for a president through a secret ballot and when we have to remove such a president, we should engage though a secret ballot. But in the end, deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli ruled against this and later read out the vote. Honourable members the voting summary is as follows: Yes is 126, no is 214, abstain is one and not voted is 58. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
