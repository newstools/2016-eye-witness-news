The DA&#8217;s motion of no confidence says that under President Zuma's leadership, state institutions have been captured by private interests. CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma has been accused of irrational, irresponsible and reckless leadership in the no-confidence motion debate in Parliament, set for Thursday afternoon.The Democratic Alliance (DA) motion is the sixth item on the order paper for today s sitting.This is the third motion of no confidence in Zuma in two years. However, it s probably set to fail with African National Congress (ANC) MPs highly unlikely to vote against their party.The DA s motion says that under Zuma's leadership, state institutions have been captured by private interests. It adds that state law enforcement and security agencies have been used to protect those interests.It also accuses Zuma of trying to avoid accounting to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and hobbling her efforts to meet her mandate.The DA says all this has led to public confidence in Zuma collapsing, a government at war with itself and as a result, the undermining of efforts to restore confidence in the economy.The ANC has 249 MPs, while opposition parties have 151, which makes it easy for the governing party to defeat the motion that requires a simple majority of 201 of the 400 MPs to succeed.Watch the debate live below:(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
