A High Court in Pretoria is hearing President Zuma&#8217;s application to interdict the state capture report. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has argued that because the Public Protector s state capture report has been finalised, President Jacob Zuma can make no claim to procedural rights in order to prevent its release. This was among the arguments presented in the High Court in Pretoria where Zuma is attempting to interdict the release of the report. #StateCapture Labuschagne for DA says Zuma can challenge report on review. GNThe report, compiled by Advocate Thuli Madonsela, is believed to expose the nature of the relationships between the president s friends the Guptas and himself, as well as several ministers. The DA has argued that the only remedy Zuma has at his disposal is to seek a review of Madonsela s report. It says that because the report is final, the president's claim to procedural rights has no basis.Earlier, Zuma s advocate, Anthea Platt SC, argued that her client s rights are not dependent on other people, which is why the intervening parties should be prohibited from opposing the application. However, the Economic Freedom Fighters says there is significant public interest in the report being released, because if the allegations are true, it might lead to the president being impeached.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
