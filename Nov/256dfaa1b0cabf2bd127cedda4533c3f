JOHANNESBURG Orlando Pirates Chairman Dr Irvin Khoza announced on Wednesday that Muhsin Ertugral officially resigned from his post as head coach following his team s 6-1 loss to Supersport United.Khoza expressed his disappointment with the situation saying, I would have loved for him to come discuss the matter with us, following it up by saying he would loved Ertugral to fulfil his responsibilities to the club. Dr Khoza: &quot;I never want to see my coaches resign. I always convince them to stay. That&#39;s what is difficult about this one. I had no chance&quot;There has been no confirmation as to who will take over the role of head coach. Khoza says the primary objective is to see out 2016. What we should do now is move on, because we have six games till the end of the year. There's nothing in the market for coaches, so we will have to resort to appointing someone within the team. Dr Khoza: &quot;We have to look internally, to see who we can call on in the interim to take over the reigns&quot;The chairman has promised to look further into the matter that now sees his club without a head coach. He has described the job of coaching a club like Pirates as stressful , saying, It s never nice losing a coach at this time of the season. But I always try my best to persuade coaches to stay. It always looks easy from the outside, but you realise it s a lot of hard work when you come in.
