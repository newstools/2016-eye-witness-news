The students deny contravening a UP court order saying they had gathered outside the Hatfield campus to mourn a murdered UJ student. PRETORIA - A group of 16 University of Pretoria (UP) students arrested early yesterday morning have been granted bail of R1,000 each in the Pretoria Magistrates Court. Police arrested the students for allegedly contravening a court order, however, they claim they were holding a peaceful night vigil. The 16 students deny they contravened a UP court order, saying they had gathered outside the Hatfield campus in order to mourn the University of Johannesburg student who was shot and killed at the weekend. However, their arrests come a week after a similar night vigil ended in chaos in the streets of Hatfield where students went on the rampage and vandalised cars and building and blocked streets. The students are due back in court in January. Meanwhile, the Tshwane University of Technology has suspended face-to-face classes and tests at its Soshanguve campuses following ongoing violent protests and disruptions.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
