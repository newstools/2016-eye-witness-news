The ANC chief whip has announced a crackdown on some of the party&#8217;s MPs who he says bunked Parliament. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says truant Members of Parliament (MPs) in his party have shown disrespect for the public and Parliament.He s announced a crackdown on some of the party s MPs, who he says bunked Parliament this week and in turn sabotaged the passage of an important bill.Mthembu says MPs who were absent without leave will have to face a caucus disciplinary hearing to be led by senior MP Mathole Motshekga. This will ensure that the appropriate consequences possible are meted out against the delinquent MPs, to send a strong message. Mthembu says voters deserve better. The public desire representatives that take their Parliamentary tasks seriously and demonstrate commitment. The Division of Revenue Amendment Bill could not be passed because there weren t enough MPs in the chamber.The draft law provides for funds to be allocated to the provinces and local government to deliver services.Mthembu said while the absence of Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters MPs didn t help, the ANC could have managed the 201 votes needed to pass the Bill on its own.He said said it s the first time draft legislation has been brought before the house twice and still failed to muster enough votes to pass.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
