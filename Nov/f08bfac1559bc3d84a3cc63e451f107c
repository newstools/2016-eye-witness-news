President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s lawyer Anthea Platt argued that he is protecting his procedural rights. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma s legal team has withdrawn his bid to postpone the state capture interdict case with arguments set to be heard today.Yesterday a panel of judges ruled a grouping of opposition parties and former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor can intervene in the case as respondents.However, after a full day in court, the merits of the case weren't dealt with.President Zuma s legal team has argued that he has the right to interview witnesses who submitted evidence in the state capture investigation and answer questions that were put to him by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.WATCH: The Guptas captured Zuma, and Zuma captured the State!Advocate Anthea Platt argued that the president is protecting his procedural rights.But the Democratic Alliance (DA) has indicated in court papers that Zuma lied to the court by first stating in his replying affidavit that if the report is final it should be released, and then he can challenge the findings on review.Then he questioned the finality of the report and the new public protector confirmed that it is indeed final.The DA says Zuma s legal team claims that its initial statement on this issue was a typographical error.Opposition parties will argue today that the Public Protector's office is obliged to release the report because it's final and that there's compelling public interest.
