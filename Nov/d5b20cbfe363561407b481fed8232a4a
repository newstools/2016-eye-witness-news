Hair and jewellery regulations will be the same for boys and girls at a Newlands school. CAPE TOWN - The Governing Body Foundation says Westerford High School s decision to change its dress code policy is progressive, but may not suit all schools.Hair and jewellery regulations will be the same for boys and girls at the Newlands school.Boys will now be allowed to wear ponytails, man-buns, afros and cornrows - as long as their hair is tied back, clipped and neat. Boys will also be allowed to wear earrings.But the foundation's Tim Gordon says such policy changes shouldn't be forced on other intuitions. I hope it won t be seen in a way that every school now has to do the same thing and come to the same decision. I believe there are some hopes and warnings that need to be expressed. This shouldn t be used as a model forced onto other schools. Gordon says this might not work at other schools. Democracy was allowed to work at Westerford, but we need to allow democracy to work in all schools. This school wanted change, innovation and renewal. They have also wanted that and also always done it that way, but some schools and communities don t want that change. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
