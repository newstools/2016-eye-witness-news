As citizens of this country we will do everything in our power to protect the Constitution [by] making sure that these institutions continue to be independent, they are not politically influenced. If we do dare allow the state capture to continue, which seems to be happening blatantly now, we run the risk of [allowing] the poor to continue to be poor. In Gauteng, security has been heightened outside the High Court in Pretoria where President Jacob Zuma s application to interdict the state capture report is schedule to be heard.The President is expected to ask that the matter be postponed to allow him more time to read through additional affidavits submitted by people opposing his application.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
