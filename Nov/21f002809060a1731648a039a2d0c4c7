Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza has confirmed four cases, but says they have requested more details from Prasa. JOHANNESBURG - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) says more than 60 complaints related to corruption at the state-owned company have been lodged with the Hawks.This emerged on Wednesday during a Prasa briefing to Parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts to account for R14 billion in irregular expenditure identified by the Auditor-General.Members of Parliament heard some officials have been implicated in wrongdoing and steps are being taken against them. Prasa board chairperson Popo Molefe said: We have placed before the Hawks approximately another 67 cases. &quot;They are complaints and we do not want to single out Mr [Lucky] Montana because his involvement rattles all these cases. Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza has confirmed four cases, but says they have requested more details. Yesterday we received the reply from Prasa but not condemning any required information so we are moving with the investigation cases that are not yet referred to the National Prosecuting Authority.
