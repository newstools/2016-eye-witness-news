NPA head Shaun Abrahams was questioned by the justice portfolio committee in Parliament today. JOHANNESBURG National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams says investigations into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s role in a surveillance unit at the South African Revenue Service (Sars) which allegedly spied on politicians are at an advanced stage.The rand briefly extended its losses against the dollar in response to the news.Abrahams was questioned by the justice portfolio committee in Parliament about his decision to charge Gordhan and two former Sars officials, only to drop the charges a few weeks later. The NPA head told the committee that he didn't deem it necessary to tender an apology after withdrawing charges. If me reviewing a matter and giving effect to the NPA Act and the Constitution is in violation of the code of conduct of the NPA and my responsibilities, I certainly cannot see any merit in that. Abrahams says he did nothing wrong. I deny having put the good office of the NPA and the legal profession into disrepute. I deny that this was a blunder or part of a systematic blunder at the inception. When the initial decision was made to prosecute, there was a case. I made that much clear.
