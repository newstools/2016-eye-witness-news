Solly Msimanga says while Tshwane has received significant rain over the last few weeks, it doesn&#8217;t mean that water restrictions will be lifted. JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga says while the city has received significant rain over the last few weeks, the water restrictions remain in place. The mayor was giving an update on the water situation at a briefing at the Rietvlei Dam in Pretoria on Tuesday morning. In September, the municipality aimed to reduce consumption by 15%, a target that has been met. Msimanga says the recent rains are welcomed, but the water restrictions remain in place. The rains are not falling where they re supposed to be falling, that s in the Vaal, where we get our water from. We re getting a lot of water in Tshwane and certain parts of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni, but it doesn t mean that we re out of the woods as yet. He says Tshwane residents have heeded the call to conserve water. Once we started with the campaign we were supposed to reach a saving of 15%. We ve surpass that, we re now sitting on 15.8%. However, Msimanga says transgressors will soon have flow restrictors fitted to their water meters.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
