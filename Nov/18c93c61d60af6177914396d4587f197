Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said that Brian Molefe&#8217;s resignation as Eskom CEO was a great loss. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the Public Protector should not comment on Brian Molefe s resignation as Eskom CEO.Busisiwe Mkhwebane has told Eyewitness News that Molefe s resignation is a great loss and people should not start accusing those implicated in the State of Capture report of being guilty until the matter goes through a judicial process.Molefe on Friday announced that he s stepping down but emphasised the decision was not an admission of guilt.The report said it appeared Eskom had tried to push the Optimum coal mine into financial distress so the Gupta family could buy it and that Molefe had been in regular contact with the Guptas at the time.The DA s Shadow Minister of Justice Glynnis Breytenbach says it s unclear why Mkhwebane jumped to Molefe s defence. We are of the view that Mkhwebane should spend her time dealing with issues of her office and leave these matters to the past. Her predecessor penned this report and the judicial inquiry will determine this further. Until that happens, she should really keep her nose clean. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
