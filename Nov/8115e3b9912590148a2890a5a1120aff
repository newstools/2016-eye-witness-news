JOHANNESBURG A fugitive rabbi arrested in South Africa earlier this year will serve the next 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to sexual assault. Rabbi Eliezer Berland was arrested and extradited to Israel in July this year after evading authorities for three years.The 79-year-old rabbi signed a plea bargain agreement with Israeli authorities last week and pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault against two of his female followers. Berland, who is the founder of the Shuvu Banim Yeshiva in the old city of Jerusalem, fled Israel in 2012 and spent three years hopping from one country to the next, accompanied by dozens of devout followers and evading authorities. He was finally arrested in South Africa in April, handed over to Interpol and extradited. It s understood he had been recorded confessing to his crimes on tape but many of his followers have decried the allegations as a witch-hunt.He has twice evaded arrest in South Africa, once last year when police raided his hideout at a hotel in Midrand and also during a high-speed car chase.Berland was arrested in Amsterdam last year, but managed to escape and re-enter South Africa.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
