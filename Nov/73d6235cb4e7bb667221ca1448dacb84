The SACP&#8217;s 2nd Deputy General, Jeremy Cronin, says Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has done the right thing by stepping down. JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party (SACP) s first deputy General Secretary, Jeremy Cronin, says other people implicated in the Public Protector s State of Capture report should follow Eskom CEO Brian Molefe s example, and resign.Molefe announced on Friday that he s leaving Eskom at the start of next year.Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s report found he had made dozens of phone calls to the Gupta family while they were negotiating a deal that saw them taking over the Optimum Coal Mine and receiving a huge prepayment from Eskom.Molefe however says his resignation is not an admission of wrong doing.But Cronin says Molefe has done the right thing. We think it s related and we think that whatever he might say clearly it s connected to his involvement in the series of activities related to the Gupta family in particular. The SACP has previously been highly critical of the Gupta family and called on President Jacob Zuma to publicly distance himself from the family for his own good.Meanwhile, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has said she is saddened by Molefe's resignation, but respects his decision.Brown said Molefe has been instrumental in developing Eskom s turnaround strategy and it s disappointing that he won t be around to see it completed.She said she will work closely with the Eskom board to ensure that the company remains stable but says that Molefe leaves a strong executive.The Public Enterprises Minister said that during Molefe s tenure, Eskom managed to connect almost 100,000 houses to the grid with overall revenue increasing.Added to this, she said there have been 460 days with no load shedding.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
