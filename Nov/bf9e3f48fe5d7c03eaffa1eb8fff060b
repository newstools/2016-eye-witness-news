It's understood a reporter at the airport forced his way and continued to harass Faf du Plessis for comment. JOHANNESBURG Proteas team manager Mohammed Moosajee has condemned the approach used by Australian media and Channel 9 News in the manner in which they dealt with issues around Faf du Plessis.Moosajee has released a statement where he states why it was unnecessary for the media to accost Du Plessis at the airport regarding the alleged ball tampering issue. Australian media and Channel 9 News in particular have been advised on numerous occasions over the past few days that Cricket South Africa and captain, Faf du Plessis, are not in a position to comment on the alleged ball tampering issue. Moosajee says despite doing their best to cooperate with the Australian media, Channel 9 News behaviour is disappointing. We have advised of our media protocol which has been blatantly ignored, both at the team s hotel in Melbourne on Friday and Saturday and again at the airport in Adelaide today. This is the third incident of a reporter aggressively harassing our players with blatant disrespect of the above-mentioned media protocol. It's reported a reporter at the airport forced his way and continued to harass Du Plessis for comment. He was advised to move three times, and did not adhere to this request.
