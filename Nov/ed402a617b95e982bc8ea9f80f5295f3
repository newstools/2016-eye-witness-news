JOHANNESBURG - Former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene says citizens play a vital role in holding public servants accountable, and maintaining healthy institutions. Nene was speaking at the Management College of South Africa in Auckland Park during the launch of a new program. The former minister said that good governance was important for a democracy and when this failed, corruption thrived. A society of sheep gets leadership of wolves. Nene said that the National Development Plan outlined three pillars for it to be a success, one of which was an active citizenry. It s a thriving business, a professional public service and an active citizen. Nene said that the protection of the country's institutions cannot be left to politicians alone. Whatever that doesn t work in our society, we re all complacent and we find ourselves having played a role for it to succeed. South African Local Government Association (Salga) President Parks Tau added his voice, saying that there needed to be a new calibre of public servant, one that acted with professionalism and treated governance like they would a business.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
