State Security Minister Mahlobo says his encounters with an alleged rhino horn smuggler were not of business in nature but purely pleasure. PRETORIA - State Security Minister David Mahlobo insists the first time he heard the name of an alleged rhino horn smuggler whom he s suspected of being linked to was when Al Jazeera questioned him about their relationship. The television network says the man who owns a spa in the Mbombela area claimed in an undercover interview that he knew Mahlobo. The minister has denied the claims but has admitted that he visited the spa for massage treatments and manicures. Minister Mahlobo says his encounters with the alleged rhino horn smuggler were not of business in nature but purely pleasure. The first time I even knew the name of the man was when I actually got the questions. I ve seen the face there. What evidence is there, is that I had to go for spa treatment like everybody else. It is the most popular spa treatment in Mpumalanga. He says the photo that has been produced of himself and the Chinese national is not evidence of any wrong-doing. If people are going to request to take photos, does it mean connection [and/or] friendship? Even the photo that they ve seen there, they are putting my beautiful hands when I m doing a manicure. Mahlobo has asked the police to investigate the allegations against him as well as the spa owner.LISTEN: David Mahlobo denies criminal rhino poaching connection
