The Social Justice Coalition has called on constitutionally mandated bodies to take action against allowing state capture to happen. CAPE TOWN - The Social Justice Coalition (SJC) says the cycle of poverty will never be broken if constitutionally mandated bodies, such as the Public Protector, allow political interference to get in the way of carrying out their duties.The SJC were joined by several other organisations, including Ndifuna Ukwazi and Equal Education, in a march through the city of Cape Town yesterday.They handed over a memorandum to the Public Protector, National Prosecuting Authority and South African Revenue Service.The SJC s Phumeza Mlangwana says that pressing demands such as free education will never be realised if state capture is allowed to occur. The people will never get the employment they want. The fees that our people are fighting for, they will never get free education. #StateCapture Last stop for the demonstrators: NPA&#39;s office in Bree street.
