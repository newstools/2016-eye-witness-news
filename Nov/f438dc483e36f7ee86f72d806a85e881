On Thursday afternoon, Jackson Mthembu announced that he was suing Hlaudi Motsoeneng for R1 million for defamation. JOHANNESBURG The lawyer representing African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Jackson Mthembu in his defamation claim against Hlaudi Motsoneng, says that the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) executive has simply failed to respond to a request for him to withdraw a claim that he met him in a hotel to discuss a business deal.Last month, the group executive of corporate affairs at the SABC said on live television that Mthembu must stop criticising him otherwise he would tell the world about a particular meeting they had had.On Thursday afternoon, Mthembu announced that he was suing Motsoeneng for R1 million.In October, Motsoeneng used a New Age business briefing on the SABC to attack the ANC s chief whip. That meeting was coordinated by someone, and we met. But we met so many people, but they know that no one can capture me. Mthembu s attorney Niqci Galaktiou says this claim is simply not true. He makes reference to a secret meeting that took place in a hotel, a meeting that the chief whip is unaware of and outright denies these unsubstantiated allegations. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
