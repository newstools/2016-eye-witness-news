On the succession, we have agreed that we must go to the regions and talk principles first , he said.STALWARTS RAISE CONCERNS OVER THE PARTY S FUTUREOn Friday, ANC veterans met with the party s national working committee (NWC) for the second time in one week.The stalwarts had requested a meeting with President Jacob Zuma on the direction the ruling party is taking, especially under his leadership.The ANC says it views the issues raised by the veterans very seriously, especially on the health and strength of the movement.On Saturday, Mantashe said the NEC agreed that two days of the party s policy conference in 2017 will be set aside to look at the issues raised by the stalwarts.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
