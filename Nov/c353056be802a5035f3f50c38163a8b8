In 1995 the Bakwena Ba Mare A Phogole approached the land commission claiming they were disposed of land rights on affected properties. JOHANNESBURG - The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights has called on residents in Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Sedibeng to look through a government gazette that may have affected the land they're living on.In 1995 the Bakwena Ba Mare A Phogole approached the commission claiming they were disposed of land rights on the affected property.In 1998, upon preliminary investigations, the claim was found to be frivolous and dismissed by the commission.The clan then challenged the dismissal and the commission consented to the validity of the claim.The commission says people living in the mentioned areas should check whether the claim affects them so they can submit their concerns within 60 days from the date the gazzette was published.Regional Land Claims Commissioner Lebjane Maphutha says, The claim has to be investigated, we have to issue what they call a gazette notice, inviting everybody who is interested, who is affected, to make their point known. He has denied allegations that land claim cases have been given more attention because the matter has frequently been in the news. There are those claims that are very complicated, and in order to arrive at finality with respect to those claims you will have to do a number of things. Affected parties have until January to submit concerns to the commission.Thereafter the feasibility to give the Bakwena Ba Mare A Phogole clan the land will be discussed.(Edited by Neo Koza)
