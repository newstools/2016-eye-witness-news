The 80-year-old died on Thursday after suffering from terminal lung cancer. JOHANNESBURG - The Young Communist League of South Africa says the death of Clive Derby-Lewis was long overdue .The 80-year-old died on Thursday after suffering from terminal lung cancer, leading to his release on parole last year.The league says it s neither sympathetic nor shocked about his death because he assassinated their late South African Communist Party general secretary Chris Hani.Derby-Lewis was found guilty of supplying polish immigrant Janusz Walus with the gun that killed Hani at his Boksburg home in April 1993.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission declined to give Derby-Lewis amnesty in 1999, saying he had not offered full disclosure about Hani s murder.The YCL s Molaodi Wa Sekake says: Clive Derby-Lewis never deserved to live and his departure to us is a good riddance. We still need to know the truth around comrade Hani s assassination. We will continue to struggle and demand the truth from the remaining cold blooded murder, to disclose all the circumstances and accomplices. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
