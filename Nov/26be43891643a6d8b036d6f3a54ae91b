Residents who have been displaced by recent floods say they have not received adequate support from government. JOHANNESBURG Some Alexandra residents have lashed out at ward councillors who they say have not provided support and assistance to the displaced flood victims. Some community members met on Saturday to discuss the challenges they face following losing their homes and belongings in the flash floods earlier this month.Seven people lost their lives, including a three-year-old girl, when floods swept through parts of Johannesburg displacing those whose shacks were in low lying areas.While temporary shelter has been organised by community members and leaders to accommodate people and local nursery schools, residents say they would like a more permanent solution.A resident from ward 105 says they have resorted to seeking help from ward councillors from other wards. We were getting food from ward 9, we got food from those councillors. They tried their level best. They say while government officials including President Jacob Zuma visited the area following the floods, there is still no concrete solution to tackle the housing crisis.
