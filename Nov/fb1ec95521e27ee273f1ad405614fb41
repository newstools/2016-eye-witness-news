The Presidency issued a statement saying that President Jacob Zuma was concerned about the bill&#8217;s constitutionality. JOHANNESBURG - Political analysts say President Jacob Zuma s decision to refer the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill back to the National Assembly may be a delay tactic.On Tuesday the Presidency issued a statement saying Zuma is concerned about the bill s constitutionality.The bill was passed by Parliament earlier this year. The draft legislation will require a senior bank official to approve the accounts of prominent influential persons and oblige banks to establish the source of funds, as well as monitor these accounts on a regular basis. There have been a number of lobby groups who urged President Zuma not to sign the Fica bill.Political analyst Benedict Dube says if Zuma had signed it, he would have put himself in a predicament. If he signed it, even he himself is supposed to be subjected to it. South Africa politics are very polluted in terms of who are funding these politicians. Analyst Ralph Mathekga says Zuma may not want to be seen as making big decisions at the moment. He s avoiding to be seen as the one who makes the final decision on this. Taking it back to Parliament is a dignified way of letting others take responsibility for it. Zuma raised a red flag about the introduction of warrantless searches in the bill. Parliament is no under pressure to deal urgently with the President s constitutional concerns.(Edited by Winnie Sefularo)
