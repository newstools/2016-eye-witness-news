The Economic Freedom Fighters made the claim after their motion calling for the repeal of apartheid laws was voted against. CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of defending apartheid laws.The red berets laid the charge after an EFF motion calling for the repeal of apartheid laws still on the statute books was voted against by 179 to 86, with eight abstentions.EFF leader Julius Malema has been charged under the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 after calling on people to occupy land.The EFF wanted a parliamentary committee set up to identify and repeal a raft of pre-1994 laws still in force.Justice Minister Michael Masutha says only three sections of the Riotous Assemblies Act are still in force and that they re needed to act against incitement and conspiring to get others to commit a crime They remain necessary, as putting them aside without anything in their place would result in the state being unable to respond to anarchic behaviour sought to be propagated by the EFF. The EFF s Floyd Shivambu said: What is wrong, why do you want to sustain the apartheid laws? The SA Law Reform Commission says it s actually more than 2000 pieces of legislation that need to be looked into. Masutha says the act has come before the Constitutional Court in certain cases and would have been struck down if it was unconstitutional.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
