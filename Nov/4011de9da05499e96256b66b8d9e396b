The non-executive chair says the investigation is &#8216;in the spirit of transparency&#8217;. JOHANNESBURG - Trillian Capital non-executive chair Tokyo Sexwale says he has launched a probe into the conduct of some employees in the company in the spirit of transparency .Sexwale announced on Friday that Geoff Budlender would lead investigations into claims by the Sunday Times that Trillian knew of the axing of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene two months before it happened, and scored millions of rand from state-owned companies for work it never did.He says information provided by a whistleblower to the office of the Public Protector would be used and has called on those with information to come forward. It is the spirit of transparency and openness that we have decided to do this. I could conduct an investigation because I m independent as non-executive chair. But to ensure this investigation can be credible, we have decided to appoint somebody who is out there. It s already out there, it s public. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
