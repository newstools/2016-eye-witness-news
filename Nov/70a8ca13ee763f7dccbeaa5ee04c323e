Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe John Mangudya claims that adopting the rand could actually be very dangerous for Zimbabwe. HARARE - As Zimbabwe s central bank gets ready to release unpopular bank notes, locals are desperately looking for alternatives and one of the suggestions has been that Zimbabwe should formally adopt the rand.But Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe John Mangudya claims that adopting the rand could actually be very dangerous for Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe's former Finance Minister Tendai Biti wanted to join the Rand Monetary Union in 2010 but back then the idea was quickly shot down.Now that Zimbabweans are terrified of what bond notes are going to do to the economy, they are asking why Zimbabwe can't formally adopt South Africa s currency.After all, it was the main currency used in Bulawayo and Matabeleland for some time and it s not as strong as the US dollar, which should make it more attractive to the Reserve Bank in Zimbabwe.But Mangudya told Tuesday's edition of the state-run Chronicle that South Africa can t supply the whole region with currency.Critics say the bigger question may well be: would the members of the Rand Monetary Union allow Zimbabwe to join up anyway?
