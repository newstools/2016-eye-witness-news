Mcebo Dlamini&#8217;s lawyers say issues discussed in that meeting and his subsequent detention prove the case is politically motivated. JOHANNESBURG - Student leader Mcebo Dlamini s lawyers say a meeting between President Jacob Zuma, Justice Minister Michael Masutha and National Director of Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams may have resulted in the arrest of their client.Dlamini s lawyers say the issues discussed in that meeting and the subsequent detention of Dlamini is one of the motivations for their argument that the case is politically motivated.Dlamini appeared before the Palm Ridge Court today for a bail appeal hearing after the initial bail application was denied.His lawyer Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi says his client has been detained for three weeks despite the fact that he has not been proven guilty and this goes against the spirit of the law.Ngcukaitobi says although they respect that the judge is still to make his ruling, their stance that the case is politically motivated and other factors make them confident that Dlamini will be granted bail. On 10 October there was a meeting between the President, Minister of Justice and NDPP where he says they were to discuss how to deal with the #FeesMustFall protests and on 16 [October] our client was arrested. The advocate says they have proven that the previous court that denied Dlamini bail erred in law.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
