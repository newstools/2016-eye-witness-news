Steve Komphela &amp; his Kaizer Chiefs side seem to be worsening. JOHANNESBURG - Steve Komphela and his Kaizer Chiefs side seem to be worsening as the team has now gone six games in all competitions without a win, following Tuesday night's draw with Cape Town City.Amakhosi drew first blood through Michelle Katsvairo, but were then reduced to 10 men when a mean challenge from Sibusiso Khumalo on Thamsanqa Mkhize warranted his marching orders.City would up the ante and apply more pressure on Chiefs, but their final third play let them down repeatedly.They eventually found a breakthrough after plenty of squandered chances, then Matthew Sim found the back of the net through a deflection.Eric Tinkler's men tried to keep the momentum up, but their final touches in and around the box were less than flattering.For Chiefs, the woes continue, as they keep losing touch with the leading pack.But this are are looking rosy at the moment For City, as they ve now become the team to beat.City faces second-placed Wits on Friday and have a chance to extend their lead.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
