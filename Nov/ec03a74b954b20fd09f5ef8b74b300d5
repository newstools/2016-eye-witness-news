State Security Minister David Mahlobo said the Wits student activist had visited his house on several occasions but later disputed his own claim. PRETORIA - State Security Minister David Mahlobo is expected to provide an explanation to Parliament over his contradictory statements on Wits University #FeesMustFall student activist Mcebo Dlamini. Earlier this week Mahlobo said he knew Dlamini and that the activist had visited his house on several occasions but in Parliament on Wednesday, he disputed his own claim. The minister has been criticised this week following allegations that he s linked to a self-confessed rhino horn smuggler who owns the spa where Mahlobo has manicures.The minister has also denied that claim. On Monday, Minister Mahlobo volunteered information about his alleged relationship with Dlamini. I happen to know Mcebo, he has been to my house several times. But in Parliament two days later he changed his tune. My answer Madam Speaker, the meeting never took place. Mcebo Dlamini has not been in my house and I m not his spokesperson. Mahlobo s spokesperson Brian Dube says he s not in a position to provide any explanation for the contradiction but says the minister will provide one to Parliament.
