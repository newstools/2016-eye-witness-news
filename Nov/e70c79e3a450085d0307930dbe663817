England beat South Africa 37-21 in the Boks first official test match in the Northern hemisphere on Saturday. JOHANNESBURG England put in a dominant performance in front of their home fans to comfortably beat South Africa 37-21 in the Boks first official test match in the Northern hemisphere on Saturday.Much was made in the days building up to the match about the size and physicality of the Springbok pack, and the tactic looked to have worked when Patrick Lambie put South Africa 6-0 up early in the first half at Twickenham. The hosts however grew into the match, and found the try line in the second quarter through Johnny May.Unforced errors were the undoing of the Boks from that point, with South Africa heading into the tunnel at half time 20-9 down after Courtney Laws added another try before half time.The second half started with the English in the ascendency, with a further two tries coming from George Ford and Owen Farrell to cancel out South Africa s own two from Johan Goosen and Willie le Roux.Springbok coach Allister Coetzee will certainly spend the next week ruing the errors his side made throughout the afternoon, and will be fully aware that they need to win their next two matches against Italy and Wales if they want to end the year with a 50 percent win rate.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
