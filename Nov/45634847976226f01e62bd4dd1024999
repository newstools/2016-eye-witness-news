The DA says the minister must explain why the OHSC can’t measure the quality of maternal health care five years on. JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it has written to the Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi  to explain to Parliament why the Office of Health Standards Compliance (OHSC) is incapable of measuring the quality of maternal health care. In the letter also addressed to chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Health, Mary Dunjwa and the acting Chief Executive Officer of the OHSC Bafana Msibi, the party says five years since the establishment of OHSC nothing has been done on maternal health care. The DA’s shadow minister of health Wilmot James says the problem with the OHSC is that it is not independent and that minister Motsoaledi interferes with its functioning. James says the minister and Msibi must account to Parliament. “Without proper oversight given by the OHSC we don’t know exactly what the problems are; if we don’t know what the problems are, we can’t fix them. The system is in paralysis and South Africans have to wait to get quality health service after 21 years of democracy.”
