Chief Justice Mogoeng says South Africans can rest assured that the relations between the judiciary, executive and Parliament are healthy. JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says the judiciary's relationship with the other arms of government, particularly the executive, is healthy even where there appears to be tension. The Chief Justice was speaking in Midrand following a meeting with representatives from the heads of court as well as the Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio committee. The parties meet from time to time to discuss how the committee can support the judiciary in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. Mogoeng says South Africans can rest assured the relations between the judiciary, executive and Parliament are healthy. If there ever is a perceptible tension, rest assured it s a very healthy democratic tension, if you ever come across it don t even worry to ask us, it is very healthy. He says they occasionally meet. We have taken a principled stance that from time to time, the president, the leadership of Parliament and the Chief Justice will meet to reflect on those issues that we need to reflect on. Mogoeng says questions surrounding prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams fitness to hold office and the Public Protector s state capture report were not discussed at the meeting.(Edited by Neo Koza)
