The dept says Bey&#8217;s apology for contravening the Immigration Act is a clear vindication of why it took action against him. JOHANNESBURG The Home Affairs Department says Yasiin Bey s apology for contravening the Immigration Act is a clear vindication of why it took action against the American musician.The star, who is also known as Mos Def, was arrested in January after he tried to fly out of Cape Town using what he said was a world passport.He departed from South Africa on Tuesday night.The department says South Africa as a sovereign state will not refuse entry or departure to anyone as long as they have correct and approved travel documentation.Director-General Mkuseli Apleni says the fact that Mos Def applied for and traveled back to the United States on Tuesday night, with a valid US passport, proves their original argument. This is clearly a vindication of the position we had taken on this matter. Apleni says this case proved that no one is above the law. There are always laws in place to be respected by all persons, the better to protect all citizens and all visitors. He has also thanked Home Affairs officials at the port of entry for their vigilance and understanding of the Immigration Act, adding that this gives him confidence that the country is in good hands.Apleni says Mos Def has written to the Home Affairs Department and the South African government, apologising for contravening provisions of the Immigration Act, and the South African Passport and Travel Document Act.Apleni says the musician has acknowledged his mistakes. In his apology, he acknowledges and accepts that the Immigration Act sets in place a system of immigration control which regulates and administers a foreigner s entry. He says the department has accepted Mos Def s apology. The department is satisfied with the apology and has agreed in principle for him to depart from South Africa. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
