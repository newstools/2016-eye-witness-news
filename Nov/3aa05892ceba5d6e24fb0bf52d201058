From November to May the city expect an average of 7,000 cases to be reported each month. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says while the number of child fatalities from diarrhoea have decreased, the amount of reported cases remain high.The metro says its gearing up for the surge period from November up until May during which they expect an average of 7,000 cases to be reported each month.Although diarrhoea is treatable and preventable, it remains one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five.The city s Siyabulela Mamkeli says the city has seen a 72% drop in the number of children fatalities due to diarrhoea over the past five years. Cases of diarrhoea are being picked up sooner and it reduced the risk of dehydration. The one concern however, is that the fact that the number of direct cases has not decreased; so we are making progress in treating cases of diarrhoea where they occur, we still have a long way to go with our efforts of prevention.
