The SAA chair says she offers 'intrinsic value' and reiterated she will not resign. JOHANNESBURG South African Airways (SAA) chairperson Dudu Myeni believes her role at the airline offers intrinsic value and reiterated she will not resign.Fin24 is reporting Myeni has revealed reasons why she has refused to step down in a response to a question from Democratic Alliance member of Parliament David Maynier.She says her suitability as chairperson is irrelevant and she has no sound reason not to continue to serve.Her reappointment to the SAA board has been criticised because the airline has been surviving on state-guaranteed loans under her watch.Recently Myeni presented SAA s financial results, saying the airline made a loss of R1.5 billion in the 2015/2016 financial year. Although the airline has reduced its losses, the board and shareholders recognise the trend of reporting losses cannot persist and urgent action is required. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
