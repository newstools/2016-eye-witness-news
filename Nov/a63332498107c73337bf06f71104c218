President Zuma, along with Ministers Des van Rooyen and Mosebenzi Zwane want to halt the release of the Public Protector's report on state capture. JOHANNESBURG The national focus turns to the High Court in Pretoria this morning where President Jacob Zuma will seek a postponement in the state capture interdict case.The highly anticipated report compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela is believed to contain explosive details about Zuma s relationship with the controversial Gupta family and their alleged influence over Cabinet appointments.Zuma, along with Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane want to halt the release of the report.The President s lawyers have indicated they ll seek a postponement today because former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor s affidavit was only filed last week, and they haven t had sufficient opportunity to respond.President Zuma also questioned the finality of the report, but new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has indicated that it is indeed final.One of the respondents in the case, the Democratic Alliance, says Zuma lied in court papers because he initially indicated that if the report is final then it should be released, and he would then have a right to review the findings.However, the president later referred to that clause as a typographical error . Zuma has also argued that he wasn t given enough time to answer questions put to him by Madonsela or interview the witnesses who presented evidence to her.The matter is expected to be heard by a full bench of judges.WILL ZWANE, VAN ROOYEN WIN AT CAPTURING PP REPORT?Ministers Mosebenzi Zwane and Des van Rooyen have both applied for an urgent court interdict to stop the release of the highly anticipated state capture report, just hours before the matter is due to be heard in court.Van Rooyen previously applied to interdict the report and then withdrew it, saying former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had assured him there were no adverse findings against him but yesterday he filed yet another urgent application to halt its release.Zwane, meanwhile, says he had no choice but to involve himself in the matter as he was not afforded an opportunity to answer allegations.Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen made an about turn yesterday, launching yet another court interdict saying recent media reports suggest that he is implicated in the state capture report.He says he raised this with new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, but hasn t received a response.At the same time, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has also taken legal action to stop the report from entering the public domain. A few months ago Zwane was criticized for releasing a statement claiming that Cabinet had resolved to set up a judicial inquiry into banks that closed the Gupta family accounts this turned out to be untrue. Zwane and van Rooyen have stated that their appointments as cabinet ministers were not influenced by anyone other than the president. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)'
