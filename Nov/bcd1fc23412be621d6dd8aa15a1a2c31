The DA leader says if ANC MPs reject a vote of no confidence in President Zuma, they will be complicit in state capture. CAPE TOWN Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says if African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) reject a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, they will be complicit in state capture.Maimane today announced he will be laying charges against Zuma, two cabinet ministers and Eskom s CEO Brian Molefe after damning findings in the former Public Protector's state capture report.The probe into allegations of state capture was released yesterday after Zuma withdrew an application to delay its release.#DA Maimane on no confidence vote: don&#39;t tweet your dismay as an MP, come out and say &quot;enough&quot; in parliament. NM#DA Parliament led to an executive capture. We support the action from civil society yesterday. The cancer of ANC has infused ANC. NMMaimane has described President Zuma and those implicated in the report as a &quot;criminal syndicate deeply interlinked with private crony interests .The DA leader lamented Zuma s apparent inaction following the release of the report. There should ve been one official statement from the Presidency yesterday evening, a full and unconditional apology and an announcement of his resignation with immediate effect. Maimane adds it s not enough to wait for a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture to complete its work. If I suspect there s corrupt activities, I must report that. The police must also investigate without prejudice. The DA is also calling for the immediate resignation of Minister Lynn Brown, Minister Mosibenzi Zwane and Molefe.(Edited Zamangwane Shange)
