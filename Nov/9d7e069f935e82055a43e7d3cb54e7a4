Tuesday marked the deadline by which school structures made of inappropriate materials were due to have been replaced. JOHANNESBURG Equal Education has slammed Minister Angie Motshekga for failing to meet the norms and standards deadline for school infrastructure at Eastern Cape schools.The rights group released a report on Wednesday following visits to a number of schools across seven districts in that province.It says, on Tuesday it became illegal for any school to operate in South Africa without basic services or appropriate structures.Three years ago Minister Motshekga published regulations relating to the minimum norms and standards for public school infrastructure which set several deadlines for improving schools.Tuesday marked the deadline by which school structures made of inappropriate materials such as mud, and zinc were due to have been replaced and basic services such as water and sanitation were supposed to be delivered. Equal Education s Tshepo Motsepe says it s unacceptable that pupils in the Eastern Cape are forced to learn under unbearable conditions. This is a systemic crisis that we are facing in the country. The rights group says individual schools now have the power to take Motshekga and the provincial education MEC to court for failing to meet the deadline.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
