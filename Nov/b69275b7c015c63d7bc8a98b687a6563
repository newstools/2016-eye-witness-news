Mbulaheni Maguvhe, the last remaining SABC board member, has applied for an interdict to halt Parliament&#8217;s inquiry into the board&#8217;s fitness to hold office. CAPE TOWN The last remaining South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board member, Mbulaheni Maguvhe, has applied for an interdict to halt Parliament s inquiry into the board s fitness to hold office.The ad hoc committee conducting the inquiry has confirmed the latest development.Four other board members have resigned since the establishment of the inquiry, which is expected to commence hearings tomorrow.Committee chairperson Vincent Smith on Monday confirmed that Maguvhe has approached the Western Cape High Court. He was asking for the proceedings to be stopped on a number of issues, amongst others the suitability of the ad hoc committee and the legality of the summons and so forth. Smith says he was informed of the move over the weekend. I was notified by the committee secretary at about 10pm on Sunday. Apparently the letters were sent on late Saturday for us to react by Sunday 5pm, and clearly that was not possible. He says although he respects everyone s right to approach the courts, he believes the timing of the application is &quot;something the committee should discuss&quot;.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
