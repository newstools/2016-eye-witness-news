Six men hijacked an ambulance, stripping the paramedics of their uniform and attacked the TLC Children s Home, while posing as paramedics. The men also kidnapped three boys and a security guard. The police were able to trace the ambulance, and got into a shootout with the criminals, but the men got away. Police say the men were found at a nearby informal settlement with firearms that link them to other cases. The police's Kay Makhubele says he is grateful for the tip-off that led to the arrests, but they are still looking for the remaining two. The firearms which were found their possession were used in one of the robberies in Eikenhof. We are still looking for the two other suspects and are appealing to the community and also thanking them for information that led to the arrest of the suspects. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
