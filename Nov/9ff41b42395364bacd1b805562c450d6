The bill would have allowed men accused of sexually abusing underage girls to go free if they were married to their victims. PRETORIA Widespread outrage has caused Turkey s government to scrap a proposed law that would have allowed men accused of sexually abusing underage girls to go free if they were married to their victims.The bill, was scheduled to undergo a final vote in Parliament on Tuesday. The bill, introduced by the ruling AKP would have deferred sentencing or punishment for sexual assault of minors in some cases, including when the victim and the perpetrator were married.Hours before the vote, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the government had withdrawn the bill to submit it to a review by a parliamentary committee. But Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag later said the proposal had been shelved and would come back on the government s agenda only if all parties in parliament reached a consensus.He says the issue has been closed.
