The ANC has hit out at unions for making pronouncements about the party&#8217;s leadership elections. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) says unions belonging to the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) are undermining the party s control over its own internal issues.The ruling party has hit out at unions for making pronouncements about the party s leadership elections.The ANC has condemned unions who've called for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the leadership of the ANC at next year's party leadership conference.Last month, Cosatu member Nehawu also called for President Jacob Zuma to resign.At the same time, the Communications Workers Union says it will use Cosatu s next central committee meeting to table its call for Zuma to resign.The CWU s Aubrey Tshabalala says the president has put the country in crisis, limping from one scandal to the next. From the time a swimming pool was called a fire pool right up to Marikana, the chaos in Parliament and, of course, the Public Protector s state capture report. The ANC s Zizi Kodwa says these unions should not be interfering with the ANC s internal processes. The only way to change or influence the leadership of the African National Congress is to be a member of the African National Congress in good standing. Kodwa denies that the party is trying to censor unions or keep them quiet for opposing Zuma. We are just reminding them of the protocol. We never meddle, make pronouncements or announce our preferred leadership of Cosatu. Cosatu's central executive committee is due to meet next week, amid claims that some unions want to join Nehawu in calling for Zuma's resignation.On Friday, Zuma criticised those whom he says are trying to run the country through the courts, as well as ANC veterans.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
