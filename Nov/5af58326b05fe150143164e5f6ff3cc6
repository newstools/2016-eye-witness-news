Jacob Zuma says he's surprised by meetings that are being called by people who are not within the structures of the ANC. JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma has taken a swipe at African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwarts and former president Thabo Mbeki for criticising the party from outside its structures.This week, Mbeki wrote a letter to Zuma pleading with him to have talks with the more than 100 ANC veterans who have publicly expressed their concerns over the future of the party.Speaking for the first time after the release of the State of Capture report at a victory rally in Dumbe in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma hit back at those calling for him to step down saying he's not afraid of prison as he spent 10 years behind bars during apartheid.The president says he's surprised by meetings that are being called by people who are not within the structures of the ANC, but behave as though they are more important than those within the ranks.He says their actions demonstrate that they don t fully understand the party's procedures because there are systems put in place where problems can be raised.The president has described ANC members criticising the party as a minority who are trying to change the decisions taken by the majority.Zuma has singled out Mbeki s letter saying he was not writing to him but was clearly writing it for the entire country.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
