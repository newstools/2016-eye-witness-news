The backlash comes after Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom tabled a motion of no confidence in the president. PRETORIA It seems as if a backlash against those who called for President Jacob Zuma to stand down has begun with the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) condemning the party s national executive committee (NEC) members that have raised a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma, saying they are out of order.The NEC meeting is currently sitting at an extended meeting the St George s Hotel in Centurion where Zuma s fate is likely being discussed.This is after Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom tabled a motion of no confidence against the president. The KZN ANC was the first to come up in support of President Zuma after the Nkandla Constitutional Court judgement, and have even gone as far as calling on people to donate money for the president after the National Treasury indicated how much he must pay for non-security features at Nkandla.Now they say those tabling a motion of no confidence against the president are out of order.KZN spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says: It doesn t sound logical that NEC members can go around canvassing for the president to be removed while they were elected together by the conference of the ANC. He says NEC members were never given the mandate to table this motion by ANC structures. #KZNANC says NEC members were never given the the mandate to table the motion against Zuma by ANC structures.CMEarlier the presidential motorcade was seen leaving the hotel.Zuma has left the NEC gathering in Irene to meet with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.#ANCNEC A presidential convoy has just left the meeting.
