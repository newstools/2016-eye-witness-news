JOHANNESBURG - Wits vice chancellor Adam Habib says the university remains committed to fighting crimes including rape, despite accusations by students that it s failed to act against an alleged rapist at one of its residences.Habib has announced the appointment of researcher and gender activist Nomboniso Gasa to probe the university's handling of an alleged rape of a student at the Junction residence.It's understood the woman was raped by a fellow student who stays in the same building.The Junction house committee is calling on Habib to resign, claiming Wits dragged its feet in dealing with the incident.Habib has criticised the students for addressing the matter through the media, rather than using university structures.He's also called on them to report any other sexual abuse cases. You think that politics has to happen on Twitter and in the media. What you don t recognise is that s Donald Trump politics, not the politics of a democratic society. So I urge house committees, if you have charges, bring them and let s investigate them. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
