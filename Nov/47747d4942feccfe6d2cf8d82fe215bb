We don t have lots of policing in Honeydew during the night. It will take maybe three to four hours when you phone the police to arrive at your place. Police say a lack of resources have made policing in the area difficult.They say this could be the case because a lot of individuals are living virtually on top of each other. There s no lighting in the area, no proper infrastructure, making policing in the area tough. Police have appealed to residents not to take law into their own hands and allow law enforcement do its work.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
