The minister has told Eyewitness News that despite trying to interdict the state of capture report, he welcomes its release. JOHANNESBURG Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen has told Eyewitness News that despite trying to interdict the state of capture report, he welcomes its release.The Public Protector s report was released about two weeks ago, implicating President Jacob Zuma, former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, among others, for their alleged corrupt relationship with the Gupta family.The courts rejected interdicts by Zuma, Zwane and Van Rooyen, while the report recommended the president should appoint a judicial inquiry into the findings.Speaking exclusively to Eyewitness News, Van Rooyen said following the judicial inquiry, he would challenge the findings. We welcome that finally the report was released but also we ll of course, as provided in our legislation, exercise our right and we ll wait for an opportune time to give response into some of the allegations that are leveled against some of us. Van Rooyen said he shares the same sentiments as Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, that no one is guilty until the matter has gone through a judicial process.Cellphone records show how several people are linked to the Guptas, including Molefe, and how Van Rooyen was at the Gupta compound the night before his brief appointment as Finance Minister last year.Madonsela has called on Zuma to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry within 30 days to investigate all the issues she identified, using her record of the investigation and the report as a starting point.The former Public Protector relied on cellphone records to corroborate evidence and it places several people at the Gupta residence in Saxonwold where secret meetings took place.This is also where Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas claims he was offered the job of Finance Minister by Ajay Gupta when he made the claim in a public statement earlier this year.Read the Public Protector's full 'State of Capture' report below: State Capture Report 2016 by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
