JOHANNESBURG - Kyle Brown has stepped down as the Blitzboks captain with Philip Snyman being named as his replacement.He s played 56 World Rugby Sevens Series tournaments thus far. Snyman is no stranger to the captaincy, he lead the team out in four tournaments earlier this year. Neil Powell will name his squad for the Dubai series on Friday.Brown says it was an honour to lead this team: It was an awesome time, I ve had a great run. It s been something very special to be a part of. I m stoked I can stay on a bit longer and add some value to the team. Phillip will do a phenomenal job. I m keen to get involved more. Brown says he feels like the timing is right: Now that the Sevens are in the Olympics and it s the end of this cycle, what s the value of me staying on for the next four years? It s unlikely that I ll make the next Olympics, why hold on and take that opportunity for someone else to grow into that role. Brown says the squad is excited to step things up this season: We ve had a good consistency within the squad over the last few months. We re trying to add as many young faces to the squad as possible. We want to take our game to the next level this season. We ve played some great, consistent, strong rugby the last few seasons. Everyone is dying to go that extra little step forward. The 2016/17 World Sevens Series gets underway on 2 December.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
