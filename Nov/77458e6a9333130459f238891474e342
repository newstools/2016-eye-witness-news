Save the Children has released a report on the long-term cost of emotional, physical &amp; sexual abuse. CAPE TOWN - Child abuse has cost the South African economy R238 billion in 2015, according to research by the non-governmental organisation, Save the Children.The organisation has released a report on the long-term cost of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.Save the Children s Dr Celia Hsiao says the research looked at the monetary impact of fatal abuse and the loss of productivity due to abuse. As a society we need to begin in investing in preventing violence against children from happening. This cost of R238 billion, is the cost of inaction. SA people have become numb to violence, as we build up to 16 days of activism, we do not see anyone marching against child abuse @tgndebeleParents are overwhelmed by hunger and what they have to deal with daily. Positive parenting plays a role in stopping child abuse @tgndebeleShe says the Social Development department s current prevention budget is too small. The budget prevention, early intervention is less than 1% of the total Department of Social Development budget, that s very little money for prevention. Hsiao adds the R238 billion lost due to abuse in 2015 is a grossly underestimated figure due to a lack of government data.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
