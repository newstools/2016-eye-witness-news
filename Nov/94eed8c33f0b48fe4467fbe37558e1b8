The 28-year-old singer was trained in the musical arts at the prestigious BRIT School in London. LOS ANGELES - Adele is reportedly planning on teaching "a few classes" at the BRIT School in London once her tour is over. The 28-year-old singer was trained in the musical arts at the prestigious BRIT School in London, and sources have suggested that she has been "seriously" thinking about returning to the performing arts institute to "teach a few classes". A source told The Sun on Sunday newspaper: "Adele is grateful for the success she's had and has been talking a lot about her beginnings while on tour. "Tony Castro, who was head of music at the BRIT School, is someone she feels particularly grateful to because he made students write their own songs. "And talking about how teachers influenced her has made her think more seriously about teaching herself. "Once she has recovered from the tour, she would love to teach a few classes." The Hello hitmaker's possible turn to teaching comes after she recently stated she wanted to take time off from touring in order to give her four-year-old son Angelo - whom she shares with partner Simon Konecki - a little sibling. She said on stage recently: "I'll see ya later, I'll see ya on the other side. In a couple of years when I'll be back, you won't be able to get rid of me. I'm going to go and have a baby." And it isn't the first time the blonde beauty has openly discussed having a second child, as she said last month her "womb is starting to ache" with the need for another baby. She said: "I'm starting to get very emotional about it because I feel like once they turn four, they're not really your actual baby anymore. "So my womb is starting to ache a little bit. It's like, 'Baby, baby, baby. Need a baby, need a baby'. I'm not pregnant. I won't get pregnant until the end of the tour."
