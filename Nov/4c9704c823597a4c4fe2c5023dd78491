JOHANNESBURG - National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams has spoken out about personal attacks on him and his character.Yesterday, the NPA head announced withdrawal of fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay.WATCH: Shaun Abrahams in the wake of the Gordhan chargesAbrahams has been the subject of many memes on social media and has been mocked by cartoonists, with many ridiculing his eyebrows and labelling him &quot;Shaun the sheep&quot;.He says he was very mindful of the narrative put out by the media when he first announced the decision to charge Gordhan. I don t think any senior government official, senior leader of an institution or politician has even been subjected to such an attack in public. I ve been very mindful of it. Abrahams says he s not on social media, but is aware that he is public enemy number one. It tells you where we ve come to as a nation and as a people, when people resort to taking things to such a personal level. The two biggest jokes in SA at this moment is Springbok Rugby and Shaun Abrahams.#ShaunAbrahams looks, sounds like a bad stand-up comedian whose jokes are going down like a lead balloon... a bad MC at a cheap event https://t.co/is6tipNpGVI have just listened to a clip of the #shaunabrahams briefing.
