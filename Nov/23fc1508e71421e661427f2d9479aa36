The community-based forums claim the government's fishing rights allocation is unbalanced. CAPE TOWN - Some groups are calling for Parliament to review the Fisheries Department's fishing rights allocation policy because they say it's unfair to small-scale fishermen.Several organisations are making submissions to Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on the implementation of the small-scale fisheries policy.The community-based forums claim the government's fishing rights allocation is unbalanced because it favours big, commercial companies.Masifundise's Naseegh Jaffer says aspects of the policy have to be re-worked. We want the policy to be implemented. We are saying hold only allocating commercial rights because that s all you re doing. You re only allocating commercial rights and not allocating anything to small scale. We re saying treat us fairly and equally. Committee chairperson Rosina Semenya says any review will follow a process and cannot happen overnight. We must have discussions with those that have accepted or drafted the policy to include the parts that must be amended. We must engage on them and find a solution. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
