What did Former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene tell Thuli Madonsela during her state capture probe? JOHANNESBURG Sacked Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was interviewed in September by then Public Protector Thuli Madonsela as part of her investigation into allegations of state capture.Central to their discussion was the allegation by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that the controversial Gupta family had offered him the position of finance minister.Below is an unedited extract from the State of Capture report dealing with Madonsela s interview with Nene:5.18. I interviewed Mr Nene on 5 September 2016 to confirm if Mr Jonas discussed the alleged offer with him. Mr Nene stated the following:a) Mr Jonas informed him that he was offered a Cabinet post by members of the Gupta family shortly after the meeting had taken place;b) He does not remember the exact date of the meeting but it was a couple of months prior to his removal as Minister of Finance;c) At the time, there was speculation in the media about his removal. He therefore thought the alleged offer was just a bluff ;d) He was removed from his post as the Minister of Finance by the President on the evening of 8 December 2015;e) When informing him of the decision to remove him as Minister of Finance, the President stated that he would be deployed to the Africa Regional Centre of the BRICS Bank ;f) He apparently stated that it was discussed in the so called Top Six of the ANC; and g) Mr Nene however stated that he knew that Heads of States could not make appointments on behalf of the BRICS Bank. The appointment of Mr Nene to the African Regional Centre of the BRICS Bank never materialised.Read the Public Protector's full 'State ofCapture' report below: State Capture Report 2016 by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
