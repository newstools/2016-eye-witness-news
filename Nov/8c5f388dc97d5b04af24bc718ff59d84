A second-string South Africa side drew 31-31 with the Barbarians in an exciting try fest at Wembley on Saturday that served as a warm-up for the Springboks' test against England next weekend.The Barbarians, with four South Africans in their starting line-up and a host of players from New Zealand and Australian Super Rugby sides, were almost always ahead on the scoreboard, creating trademark running moves that the Springboks' defence struggled to deal with as both sides scored five tries.The Springboks, who have had a poor season and barely edged Argentina into last place in the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship, had the better of the set pieces but will need a marked improvement against England at Twickenham.So it is 31-all at @wembleystadiumin ten try thriller.
