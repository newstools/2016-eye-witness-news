The Junction House committee has called on the university to review the gender equity office&#8217;s protocol. JOHANNESBURG The Junction House committee at Wits University has called on management to review its policies after an alleged rape at the residence.A meeting was held between members of the committee and management on Thursday night but it appears there was no resolution. It s claimed a female student was attacked at Junction House last month and has since gone back home to Kenya.The Junction House committee says this was not an isolated incident.The committee s chairperson Nkululeko Tselane has called on the university to review the gender equity office s protocol when dealing with sexual assault and rape cases. The university enjoys rhetoric and speaking in general broad terms and says they will take responsibility but tactically what will it take responsibility for. Tselane says they are also demanding that management account for statements made by some of its members during a protest outside the residence earlier this week. Specifically when they said things like 'the rape wasn t violent'. Wits is in the meantime continuing its investigation and insists that the nature of its engagement with those involved needs to remain confidential.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
