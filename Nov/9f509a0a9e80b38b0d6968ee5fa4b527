Judge Nkola Motata was put on special leave with full pay in 2007 after he crashed his car into the wall of a Johannesburg home. CAPE TOWN - Justice Minister Michael Masutha has revealed that taxpayers have forked out nearly R14 million paying the salary of a judge who was convicted of drunken driving after he crashed his car into the wall of a Johannesburg home nine years ago.Judge Nkola Motata was put on special leave with full pay in 2007 after he ploughed into the wall of the northern suburbs house in his gold Jaguar.He was convicted of drunken driving two years later and fined R20,000. His appeal was dismissed in 2010.Masutha says Motata has been paid R13,9m since his suspension, on full pay, nearly a decade ago.Motata faces two complaints of misconduct that could see him impeached. These relate to alleged racist comments he made at the scene of the accident and for relying on a defence he knew to be untrue during his criminal trial when he was convicted of drunken driving.In a written reply to a parliamentary question from the Freedom Front Plus, Masutha says the judge s misconduct hearing has been delayed because of Motata s court action challenging the law that established the judicial conduct tribunal.Masutha has also revealed that Motata will not have to repay any of the money paid to him, should he be found guilty of gross misconduct.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
