Many of the department&#8217;s schools are classified as fee-paying schools but are attended by a large number of poor learners. CAPE TOWN The Western Cape Education Department says it s assisting 97% of fee paying schools across the province, as parents struggle to pay their children s fees.Education MEC spokesperson Jessica Shelver says many of the department s schools are classified as quintile four and five schools which are fee-paying schools.But in reality, they are attended by a large number of poor learners and should be classified as no-fee schools.Shelver says to mitigate the effects of the quintile system, the department has this year made more than R47 million available to help these struggling schools. As government, we are trying to do more to support both parents and schools that serve our poor communities. Every child has a right to basic education, and parents are struggling to pay school fees. We are pleased to say that we have been able to assist 97% of our fee paying schools with this kind of compensation despite the current economic situation. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
