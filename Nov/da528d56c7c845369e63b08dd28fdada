Western Cape High Court Judge Andre le Grange has indicated that the judgement might be delivered before the end of December. CAPE TOWN - Judgment in the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s application to have South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Group Executive of Corporate Affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng removed has been reserved.Western Cape High Court Judge Andre le Grange has indicated it might be delivered before the end of December.DA lawyers have argued that the disciplinary proceedings followed by the SABC, resulting in Motsoeneng being cleared of wrongdoing, were flawed.The DA's legal representatives argue that the Public Protector's remedial action in her report, When governance and ethics fail, was not considered during the disciplinary process that cleared Motsoeneng of any wrongdoing.Released in February 2014, former Public Protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela found that Motsoeneng had lied about being in possession of a Matric certificate and that his salary increases were irregular.The opposition party says Motsoeneng should be removed from the public broadcaster, based on numerous adverse judicial findings against him in relation to his qualifications and conduct.Motsoeneng's legal team has argued that the disciplinary process that cleared him of any wrongdoing was based on merit and made a solid finding.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
