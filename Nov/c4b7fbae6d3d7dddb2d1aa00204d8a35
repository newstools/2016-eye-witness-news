CAPE TOWN - It s been third time lucky for a crucial budget bill in Parliament.The National Assembly has passed the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill.The draft law provides for the allocation of funds to government departments.It failed to pass twice last week because there weren t enough Members of Parliament (MPs) in the chamber for a majority of 201 votes.The African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Jackson Mthembu has launched disciplinary proceedings against ANC MPs who were absent without leave last Tuesday and Wednesday.Speaker Baleka Mbete announced the result of the vote a short while ago. The yes, minus honourable [Willie] Madisha is 228. The no, minus the honourable member that came after the door had been pushed open by honourable members from outside, is 86. Zero abstentions. The bill will now be sent to the National Council of Province for concurrence.Mbete overruled EFF complaints over the process because some MPs were able to enter the chamber after voting got underway. Mbete said their votes were not taken into account.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
