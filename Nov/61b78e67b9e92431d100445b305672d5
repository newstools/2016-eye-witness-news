In 2010, Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala was nominated for the Puskas award, after his strike against Mexico in the opening match of the World Cup at the FNB Stadium.Tshabalala lost out to Turkey s Hamit Altintop that year and understandably so as his effort was nothing short of breathtaking.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
