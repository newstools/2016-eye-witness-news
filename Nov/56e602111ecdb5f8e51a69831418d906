He says the conditions that the students are expected to learn and write their exams under are not conducive. JOHANNESBURG The lawyer of the 25 Wits University students who attempted to interdict the university from commencing with the year-end exams, says the reason his clients approached the courts is because their cause is justified.Thulani Nkosi of the Socio-Economic Rights Movement (Seri) says the students initially approached the university for relief but their requests were not heeded.He says the conditions that the students are expected to learn and write their exams under are not conducive.However, with the High Court in Johannesburg having decided to dismiss their interdict application, Nkosi says the students are disappointed and will need time to gather themselves before making a decision on a way forward. And we took a decision that says perhaps everybody should go, try to cool down a bit because as you could imagine they were pretty emotional. Read the judgment and once tempers have cooled down, decide what to do. He says he argued before the High Court in Johannesburg that the students would not be ready to write the exams due to the harsh conditions on campus.Nkosi says while they did not get what they wanted, the relaxed deferred exam conditions will, however, make things easier for the students.The deferred exams for most faculties start on 1 December.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
