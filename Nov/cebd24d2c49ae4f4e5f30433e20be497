The Chamber of Mines says the Department of Mineral Resources is now trying to change the definition of transformation in the mining charter. JOHANNESBURG - The Chamber of Mines says it s clear that the Department of Mineral Resources has ignored them in drawing up the revised mining charter, and that the ministry seems to be ignoring the fact that the entire industry is in dire straits. On Wednesday, the department s deputy director-general Mosa Mabuza told Parliament that they d made progress in drawing up the revised charter.But the chamber says the department is now trying to change the definition of transformation, and wants to introduce a new levy that would be based on revenue and not on profit. The Chamber's Tebello Chabana says: Now we have the Department of Mineral Resources proposing revenue phase, contributions to mining communities development, which will be very hard on those particularly struggling and marginal mines. It s essentially adding an extra cost to them. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
