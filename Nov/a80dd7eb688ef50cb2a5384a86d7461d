Police arrested Nadeem Khan in Rondebosch last week on suspicion of selling a stolen cellphone. CAPE TOWN - The brother of a man who died in police custody says he believes authorities are trying to cover-up the circumstances around his brother s death.Police arrested 37-year-old Nadeem Khan in Rondebosch last week on suspicion of selling a stolen cellphone.The father of two was declared dead on arrival at the Rondebosch police station, a few minutes away from where he was apprehended.Amien Khan says the cause of his brother s death has not yet been determined but police have told him a postmortem shows no definite signs of brutality. How is that possible if he still has scarring on his face, his eyes are swollen and scratches on his nose? To me it looks as if he was assaulted. Khan claims police told him his brother was having difficulty breathing before he died.He asked police whether CPR was administered and was told they only unbuttoned the deceased s shirt. On reflecting, I had a look at the photos and he wasn t even wearing a shirt with buttons. He was wearing a T-shirt and so she lied. The family has confirmed Nadeem was trying to sell his own phone at the time of his arrest.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
