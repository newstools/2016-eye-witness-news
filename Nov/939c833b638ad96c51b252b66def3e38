The court does not accept the argument put forward by the government, said Lord Chief Justice John Thomas, reading out the three judges ruling. For the reasons set out in the judgment, we decide that the government does not have power ... to give notice pursuant to Article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European Union. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the government was disappointed with the court ruling and would consider it carefully before deciding how to proceed.
