JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says it wants its mother body to discipline senior officials who've criticised the president.The league has pointed specifically at the governing party's Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu.A number of other ANC members and veterans have also spoken out against the president in recent weeks, with criticism intensifying since the release of the Public Protector's state of capture report.The league's Mlondi Mkhize says they re calling for action from the ANC. We call for them to refrain from this behaviour that oppresses the movement, particularly the African National Congress. We equally call on the ANC to look at all other members, like comrade Jackson Mthembu, who must be considered to go for disciplinary hearings.
