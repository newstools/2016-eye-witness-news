Lucas Glover took a while to adjust to the slow pace of the greens at TPC Summerlin. NORTH CAROLINA - Former US Open champion Lucas Glover, boosted by a 50-foot birdie, carded six-under-par 65 to surge into the third-round lead at the Shriners Hospitals For Children Open in Las Vegas on Saturday.Glover took a while to adjust to the slow pace of the greens at TPC Summerlin, but there was no stopping him once he rolled in a monster putt at the eighth hole.He followed up with an eagle at the next en route to a 15-under 198 total, one stroke better than Brooks Koepka (70) and halfway leader Rod Pampling (71), with Geoff Oglivy and Russell Henley two behind.&quot;I didn t have the speed of the greens down the first few holes and I struggled with it the first seven holes,&quot; Glover said.The South Carolinian was a surprise winner of the rain-plagued 2009 US Open at Bethpage in New York, but instead of kicking on from that major success he has won only once since.Glover, who has gone through a divorce and struggled with a knee injury, has not finished in the top 100 on the PGA Tour points ranking for the past five seasons but showed glimpses of form with a tie for fifth at last week's event in Mississippi.Pampling, who shot a sizzling 11-under 60 in the first round, could not replicate that form and by day's end was happy simply to be within a shot.&quot;Nothing special,&quot; the Australian said of his performance.&quot;Thankfully, with that good score on the first day, I ve been able to have a so-so day, so tomorrow I have to go low.&quot;Also In Sports NewsKoepka was also downbeat about his form and, like Glover, had trouble adjusting to the greens.&quot;Ball striking was pretty poor and for some reason I couldn t get the speed of the greens,&quot; he said.
