JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has told Members of Parliament (MPs) that the actions taken by the country s major banks in closing the Gupta s accounts indicates that something is going on .He says when such action is taken, government needs to step into the shoes of investors and imagine what they think.While answering questions in the National Assembly on Wednesday afternoon, the President has also said if investors don t come to South Africa because of the decisions of banks, the public will ask what government is doing about it.On the issue of the Mineral Resources Minister Zuma says Mosebenzi Zwane has apologised for his statement on behalf of cabinet incorrectly stating that an investigation would be held into the conduct of the banks. I said I was going to engage with the minister and I did. This matter is now closed and the minister has apologised. In September, the Mineral Resources Minister issued a statement on behalf of a task team established to consider the implications of the decisions of certain banks and audit firms to close down the accounts and withdraw audit services from Gupta firm, Oakbay Investments. The Presidency later said Zwane acted in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the task team or Cabinet. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
