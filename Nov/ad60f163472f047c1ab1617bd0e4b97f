The president says he &amp; others implicated in the Public Protector's final report want the work done properly. CAPE TOWN President Jacob Zuma has given the clearest indication yet that he is preparing to challenge the state capture report.In his final question and answer session for the year in Parliament on Wednesday, the president attacked how the probe was handled, saying it was 'unfair'.Zuma also defended the Gupta family.He s labelled the decision by the country s big four banks to stop doing business with a Gupta-controlled company as suspicious and says it needs to be investigated. This report has been dealt with in a very funny way, very funny in my view. It affected me and many. No fairness, at all .Zuma says he and others implicated in the Public Protector's final report want the work done properly . We are working on it, that s why I can t go further than that. I can t then jump when I have these views, to establish a commission. Even the manner in which the recommendation is, it is the president who has a right to appoint a commission. Zuma s made it clear however that he is considering a judicial inquiry into the decision of banking and financial institutions to cut ties with the Guptas.The president has said he's also unhappy about former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela directing that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose the judge to lead an inquiry. No one, no matter what position they hold, can instruct the president to establish a commission and even tell the process through which you must go. It s very funny I ve never heard of it. So that s a problem that we re faced with in regard to this report. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
