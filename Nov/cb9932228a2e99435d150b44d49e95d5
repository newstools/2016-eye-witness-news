The Presidency has denied allegations that a pedestrian has been killed by President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s motorcade. CAPE TOWN - The Presidency has denied allegations that a pedestrian has been killed by President Jacob Zuma s motorcade in Pretoria.The Presidency is responding to a tweet from Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba's account, claiming a friend of his was killed by one of Zuma s blue light vehicles.I have just received the terrible news that President Zuma&#39;s blue lights brigades killed a friend Solly Moutlana in Pretoria yesterdayThe Presidency's Bongani Ngqulunga says Zuma was in East London on Friday for A National Council of Provinces Taking Parliament to the People event, having travelled from Cape Town. From East London he flew to KwaZulu-Natal province. He left Pretoria on Tuesday. It creates an impression that a SAPS convoy transporting President Zuma caused this painful loss of life, which is totally untrue and misleading. I was under impression that these blue lights convoys were banned in Pretoria,unless under extreme circumstancesNgqulunga says they've been informed that police are investigating after a pedestrian was knocked down by a car driven by a police officer in Pretoria.
