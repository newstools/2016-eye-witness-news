The SACP says it's unfortunate Clive Derby-Lewis passed away without disclosing who else was involved in Chris Hani's murder. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) says although it is sensitive to the loss of life, following the death of Clive Derby-Lewis, it's unfortunate that he died without disclosing who else was involved in Chris Hani's murder.Lawyers for Derby-Lewis say their client died in a Pretoria hospital on Thursday afternoon following surgical complications.Derby-Lewis had been suffering from terminal lung cancer.Polish immigrant Janusz Walus and Derby-Lewis were convicted of Hani's murder after Walus shot the political leader at his home in Boksburg.Derby-Lewis was handed a life sentence for supplying the firearm used to kill Hani.The High Court in Pretoria granted Derby-Lewis medical parole on 29 May 2015 after five previous attempts failed.The murder of Hani in April 1993 triggered nationwide riots and almost derailed the 1994 transition to a multi-racial democracy.The SACP's Alex Mashilo says the Hani family still needs closure. Our condolences to his family. Unfortunately he passed on without having made full disclosure of the truth, which we believe he knew. (Edited Zamangwane Shange)
