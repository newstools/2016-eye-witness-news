Jonas was apparently offered by the Gupta family in exchange for the role of finance minister. JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks have commended Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas for blowing the whistle on an alleged R600 million apparently offered by the Gupta family in exchange for the role of finance minister.The Public Protector's State of Capture report was released last week after legal attempts to keep it away from the public.The report cites, among other findings, an alleged corrupt relationship between the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane.It claims Duduzane was present at the Gupta s Saxonworld home when Ajay Gupta allegedly offered Jonas the position of finance minister, including the alleged bribe.The Sunday Times is reporting the Hawks are investigating Jonas, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe and ANC Treasurer Zweli Mkhize for not disclosing what had happened.However, the Hawks say there is no investigation.Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says senior government officials are compelled to report bribes under the Prevention of Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. The fact of the matter that he came out in the public, I think it shows prudence. I think we need to reflect the fact that he went further and came out. We commend leaders who come out and report this. Mulaudzi says the Hawks would like to distance itself from any claims of an investigation into Jonas, Mantashe or Mkhize.WATCH: Jonas: The Guptas offered me finance minister job(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
