JOHANNESBURG - Following their huge victory over Senegal in the World Cup qualifiers on Saturday, many would have expected Bafana Bafana to carry that momentum and spirit into their year-ending international friendly against neighbours Mozambique in Maputo on Tuesday.That wouldn t be the case, as the Mambas took the game to the South Africans and forced out a 1-1 draw.Mozambique will probably feel hard done-by to have only come away with the draw, having put Bafana under a lot of pressure, especially in the first half.Goalkeeper Ronwen Williams did himself no favours, squandering the one opportunity he got in Bafana colours, as he struggled to deal with an attack from Mozambique in the 25th minute, resulting in Clesio Bauque netting the opener for the home side.The Supersport United shot-stopper continued to have nervy moments for parts of the game, but improved as the clock ticked on.Acting head coach Owen Da Gama, who was in charge of the match in Shakes Mashaba s absence, rung some changes in the second, one of them being Bradley Grobler s inclusion, at the expense of new striker Lars Veldwijk.Grobler s introduction seemed to breathe much needed life into the match and Bafana, as he found the equalizer 11 minutes into the second half.Both sides had a good go at each other for the remainder of the game, but apart from a few close shaves, there was nothing else to write home about as the match ended in a stalemate.Bafana s next official match will be in August 2017, when they take on Cape Verde in their third World Cup qualifier at the island nation.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
