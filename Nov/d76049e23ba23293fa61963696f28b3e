JOHANNESBURG - Proteas captain Faf du Plessis has been fined his full match fee and served with three demerit points for ball-tampering. Du Plessis was found guilty for altering the condition of the ball at a hearing held by the International Cricket Council on Tuesday morning. The batsman has confirmed that he will appeal the decision, despite being allowed to play in Thursday s third Test against Australia. Should he receive one more demerit point within the next two years, Du Plessis will likely face a match suspension.Former Proteas bowler Paul Harris says Du Plessis is being unfairly treated for something that s common place in cricket. Every time someone has a chewing gum in their mouth and their shining a ball you going to have to fine them. I ve seen maybe four of five different instances, in the last six or seven Test matches where other players have done the same thing. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
