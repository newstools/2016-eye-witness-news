Parliament will tomorrow debate the no confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma tabled by the DA. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) caucus in Parliament says the Democratic Alliance s (DA) motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma is premature and ill-advised. Parliament will tomorrow debate the no confidence motion tabled by the opposition DA last month on the basis that he is not fit to hold office. ANC caucus spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says it s premature for the DA to seek the removal of Zuma on the basis of the Public Protector s State of Capture report. It is not based on any wrongdoing from the Public Protector s report it claims it is based on. So we will reject this particular motion because it is premature, there is no evidence of wrongdoing or no finding against any implicated individual. Yesterday ANC General Secretary Gwede Mantashe called on ANC Members of Parliament (MPs) to resist the temptation to play to the public gallery by supporting the motion.After the debate on the motion of no confidence was confirmed by the speaker of the National Assembly yesterday, the DA called on all 400 Members of Parliament to either speak for the people or protect President Zuma and corruption.But Mantashe said ANC MPs must toe the party line. Voting according to conscience doesn t work in a political party system. We all get into the list of things and go to Parliament as parliamentarians of the ANC. He said the DA s attempt to remove the President is a desperate move. The DA has now made this an annual and frivolous thing and it is fast losing its meaning. The party said the motion has no chance of succeeding.Additional reporting by Clement Manyathela.
