Katie Price says she is “shaken up” after having chewing gum thrown on her as she travelled on a train. LONDON – Katie Price is “shaken up” after having chewing gum thrown on her as she travelled on a train.The 38-year-old star has taken to Twitter to try and identify a group of people who she claims threw gum and "verbally abused" other rail users. Reaching out to her followers for some answers, she wrote: “Do you know this man women behind an their child? Verbally abused people throwing things throwing chewing gum at me on the train, so bad (sic).”  Katie - who has five children Harvey (14), Junior (11), Princess (9), Jett (3), and Bunny (2) from three different relationships - enjoys using Twitter to share details about her day with her followers and recently took to the site to reveal she had undergone laser eye surgery. Sharing a video of herself in sunglasses whilst on a train home, she wrote: “My eyes streaming can’t see and have to wear dark glasses but will be worth it! Such easy procedure (sic)” Her comments come just weeks after she claimed she wouldn’t be having any more operations following her 11th boob job. She said at the time: “That’s it now, I don't need any more surgery unless anyone thinks I can improve something. But no there’s no babies, no surgery. I’m back to the old Katie Price again, on a mission to do my thing.”However, Katie previously expressed her desire to adopt a child. She said: “I’ve always said I want to adopt a child, I’ve got five of my own and I’m still going to continue to have my own. I just think it’s the right time for me now to adopt a child, I want to adopt from abroad as well ...” “I would like a newborn, because I’ve got my kids. If I had an adopted child, that was say five, and that child had problems - behavioural problems not disabilities - then I don’t want it to affect my other kids.”
