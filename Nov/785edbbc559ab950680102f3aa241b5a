CAPE TOWN - The South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) has rubbished reports that it requires members to get new green coloured cards before January next year.The agency says this is the latest scam to rear its head leading up to the festive season.Sassa spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko warns that once members give crooks the necessary details it could lead to numerous unwanted deductions from their grants.Diseko adds that scammers have been contacting their targets via SMS. What our beneficiaries need to look out for is suspicious messages that say they must divulge their personal details, such as ID, card and PIN numbers. Sassa does not do that.
