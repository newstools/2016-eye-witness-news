The DA called on all 400 MPs to either speak for the people or protect Jacob Zuma and corruption. JOHANNESBURG - As the Democratic Alliance (DA) prepares to table a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma, African National Congress (ANC) General Secretary Gwede Mantashe has called on ANC Members of Parliament (MPs) to resist the temptation to play to the public gallery by supporting the motion which will be debated in Parliament on Thursday.The party has briefed the media in Johannesburg following its National Working Committee meeting yesterday.After the debate on the motion of no confidence was confirmed by the speaker of the National Assembly yesterday, the DA called on all 400 Members of Parliament to either speak for the people or protect President Zuma and corruption.But Mantashe says ANC MPs must toe the party line. Voting according to conscience doesn t work in a political party system. We all get into the list of thingsand go to Parliament as parliamentarians of the ANC. He says the DA s attempt to remove the President is a desperate move. The DA has now made this an annual and frivolous thing and it is fast losing its meaning. The party says the motion has no chance of succeeding.STATE CAPTURE REPORTThe ANC says there will not be a special national executive committee meeting to discuss the state capture report.The party says while the issues raised in the state capture report are serious, the report makes no findings and says it's observations are inconclusive.It also said calls for President Zuma to step down on the basis of the report are premature and unfounded.Mantashe says there were calls for a special NEC meeting to be held. The ANC cannot therefore preempt the outcome of that process hence to proposals we received to convince the NEC meeting to consider the report, were not acceded to. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
