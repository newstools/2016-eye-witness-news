The loose categorisation of South Africans as mentally retarded and social outcasts just because they are homeless is not only ignorant but dangerous. Chairperson of the City of Cape Town s Disciplinary Committee Benidicta Van Minnen says the matter is being attended to. At this particular point the matter is being investigated by the City, and we are not in the position to make any further comments. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
