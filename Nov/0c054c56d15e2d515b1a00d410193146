With @NomvulaMokonyan pic.twitter.com/XdtPT0LQ8RThe governing party says it will elect its new leaders in December 2017, and some of its structures have already indicated who they want to lead the organisation.The ANC s women s League and youth leagues have indicated they want a woman president to succeed President Jacob Zuma, with the name of the outgoing African Union Commision chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma being bandied around.The party says the political education programme is done with the aim of unifying the organisation as it advances towards the elective conference.At the same time, some unions affiliated to Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) want Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to be the next leader.The Communications Workers Union (CWU) says some of its members believe if Zuma would step down, the ANC could be rebuilt as a stronger organisation.The National Health Education and Allied Workers Union became the first member of the tripartite alliance to call for Zuma s axing.The union is currently having discussions on who should be the next president of the ANC.The CWU s President Clyde Mervin says, Already some of the members are of the view that he must step aside so that we can rebuild a strong ANC, rebuild a strong Cosatu, so that when the alliance is united the country will forward in a different direction.
