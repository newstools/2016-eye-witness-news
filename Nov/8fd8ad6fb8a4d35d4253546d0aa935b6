The report was compiled after a student was raped at a Wits University residence last month. JOHANNESBURG The recommendations from an inquiry on the manner in which a rape incident at Wits University was handled by the institution have been released on Friday afternoon.The report was compiled by gender activist Nomboniso Gasa after a student was raped at a Wits residence last month.One of the recommendations made states that the alleged victim was assisted accordingly by most of the Wits community but also highlights the lack of empathy that some members of the institution s staff displayed.It also says that the university should have not allowed the complainant and the alleged perpetrator to stay at the same residential block after the incident was reported. Wits vice-chancellor Professor Adam Habib says he is pleased by the recommendations. It s really a wonderful report. It s well thought through and makes very concrete recommendations and we are particularly grateful to her (Gasa) for doing that. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
