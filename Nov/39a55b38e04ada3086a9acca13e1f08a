Minister Faith Muthambi endorsed and supported Hlaudi Motsoeneng&#8217;s appointment as SABC group executive of corporate affairs. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will write to President Jacob Zuma to request that he reprimand or fire Communications Minister Faith Muthambi for defying cabinet s position on the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng to his new position at the SABC.The public broadcaster appointed Motsoeneng as a group executive for corporate affairs after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a ruling that Motsoeneng s permanent appointment as COO was unlawful.While opposition parties and some members of the African National Congress were against his employment in the new post, Minister Muthambi endorsed and supported Motsoeneng s appointment as group executive of corporate affairs.DA s spokesperson Phumzile van Damme says Muthambi s support for Motsoeneng was a clear expression of her blatant defiance of Cabinet s position. Minister Muthambi has publicly come out in support of and defended Motsoeneng s reappointment and she is therefore contradicting cabinet s position in this regard. We therefore believe that the President should reprimand or fire her. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
