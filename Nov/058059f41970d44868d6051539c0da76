106 veterans have signed a document raising concerns about what they say is the declining state of the ANC. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) President Jacob Zuma and other members of the party s national working committee are currently in a meeting with struggle stalwarts in Pretoria.One hundred and six veterans have signed a document titled For the Sake of the Country which raises concerns about what they say is the declining state of the ANC.Reverend Frank Chikane, Cheryl Carolus and Denis Goldberg are among 30 stalwarts expected to present the document in the capital today.Earlier this month, ANC stalwarts expressed their sadness over the state of the ANC under President Zuma. They blamed recent developments within the party for its dismal performance in this year s local government elections.The veterans called for a consultative conference, saying they believe it would lead to the rebuilding and renewal of the organisation. But the president has recently lashed out at the veterans while addressing supporters at rallies both in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.Zuma said some who call themselves veterans do not even belong to any ANC branch, adding that they were out of line.He also reprimanded them for overlooking party structures to raise their concerns.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
