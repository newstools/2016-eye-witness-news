The 55,000 seater stadium has been functioning at a loss of nearly R40 million in the past year. CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town wants to establish a municipal entity to take over the operations at the Cape Town stadium.Deputy Mayor Ian Nielson says this is in an attempt to minimise the financial losses that are currently being experienced.The 55,000 seater stadium has been functioning at a loss of nearly R40 million in the past year.While the city will remain the sole shareholder, an independent board will be running operations as a State-owned entity.Nielson says the entity will be tasked with finding potential income streams. With a business running it, rather than having a department, they would have greater flexibility and would be able to negotiate the use of the stadium by various parties. We believe that will lead towards greater efficiency in operation, and much greater utilisation. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
