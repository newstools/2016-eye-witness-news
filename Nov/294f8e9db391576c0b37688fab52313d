Amakhosi were held to a 1-1 draw by Supersport United at home on Wednesday night. JOHANNESBURG Kaizer Chiefs have gone four games in the Premier Soccer League without a victory and are quickly slipping down the log.Amakhosi were held to a 1-1 draw by Supersport United at home on Wednesday night, in a match that deserved more goals, particularly from the hosts.Thabo Mnyamane got Matsatsantsa on the score sheet in the 29th minute, with a great tap in, off a superb cross from Jeremy Brockie.Their joy would be short lived though, as George Lebese did well to compose himself in the box, turn the Supersport defence and slot the ball past goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse.Chiefs tried to build on the momentum of that goal and for the last 15 minutes of the first half, hit Supersport on several dangerous counter attacks, but failed to put the finishing touches to their moves.Both teams were expected to come out with the same intensity in the second half, but that wouldn't be the case as they looked very cautious in their approach.There were no shots to speak of in the second stanza as tthe both sides settled for the share of the spoils.The draw saw Supersport over take Golden Arrows on the log into third, while Steve Komphela's men fell down to fifth place, equal on points with rivals Orlando Pirates, who are in sixth, five goals adrift and with a game in hand.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
