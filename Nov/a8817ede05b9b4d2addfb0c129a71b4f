CAPE TOWN - Springbok coach Allister Coetzee has made three changes to the starting line-up for the clash against Italy on Saturday.Nizaam Carr gets his first international start on the flank, with Pieter-Steph Du Toit moving back to his preferred second row position in place of the injured Eben Etzebeth.Veteran winger Bryan Habana is recalled and will make his 124th appearance for the Springboks.On the bench Trevor Nyakane, Oupa Mohoje and Elton Jantjies take their spot in the match day 23.South Africa will look to get back to winning ways after another disappointing loss to England. The Boks will be buoyed by their record against the Italians who are ranked 13th in the world and are yet to lose to them in 12 matches.The smallest losing margin for Italy against the Springboks is 16, when they lost 13-29 in Witbank in 2010 and 6-22 in Padova in 2014. While in 1999 South Africa beat the Italians in Durban 101-0, the second highest winning margin in the history of South African Test rugby.The Test between the two sides will be played at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, a football stadium in Florence, and it will be the first time that South Africa will play at this venue.Match day squads:Italy15 Edoardo Padovani, 14 Giulio Bisegni, 13 Tommaso Benvenuti, 12 Luke McLean, 11 Giovanbattista Venditti, 10 Carlo Canna, 9 Giorgio Bronzini, 8 Sergio Parisse (captain), 7 Simone Favaro, 6 Francesco Minto, 5 Andries Van Schalkwyk, 4 Marco Fuser, 3 Lorenzo Cittadini, 2 Ornel Gega, 1 Sami PanicoBench: 16 Tommaso D Apice, 17 Nicola Quaglio, 18 Simone Ferrari, 19 George Fabio Biagi, 20 Abraham Steyn, 21 Edoardo Gori, 22 Tommaso Allan, 23 Tommaso BoniSouth Africa15 Willie le Roux, 14 Ruan Combrinck, 13 Francois Venter, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Bryan Habana, 10 Pat Lambie, 9 Rudy Paige, 8 Warren Whiteley, 7 Willem Alberts, 6 Nizaam Carr, 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Adriaan Strauss (captain), 1 Tendai MtawariraBench: 16 Bongi Mbonambi, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Trevor Nyakane, 19, Franco Mostert, 20, Oupa Mohoje, 21 Faf de Klerk, 22 Elton Jantjies, 23 Johan Goosen(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
