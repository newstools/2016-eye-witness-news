Francois Venter will make his Test debut on Saturday during England clash following his good showing against the Barbarians. CAPE TOWN - Springbok coach Allister Coetzee has handed Francois Venter his debut ahead of their clash with England at Twickenham in London on Saturday afternoon.Only five players who started in the 31-31 draw against the Barbarians last week at Wembley were again included in a much changed line-up for the Test against the English. Venter will make his Test debut on Saturday following his good showing last week at Wembley. He will partner Damian de Allende, who will win his 21st cap for the Springboks.Injuries to a handful of loose forwards, as well as the unavailability of other experienced loose forwards, means that Pieter-Steph Du Toit moves from the second row to the side of the scrum, a position he is familiar with, as he will bring much-needed ball-carrying ability and more lineout options.#ENGvSA Francois Venter makes his test debut, Adriaan Strauss returns as skipper &amp; JP Pietersen on the wing. Kick-off is at 16h30 SA time.He will form part of a powerful loose trio as experienced Willem Alberts will start on the other side of the scrum, while Warren Whiteley retains the No. 8 jersey he wore throughout the Rugby Championship.Those changes make way for Lood de Jager to return to the starting line-up after serving his one-match suspension against the Barbarians.In the front row, hooker Adriaan Strauss returns to action and he takes over the captaincy from Pat Lambie. Vincent Koch will play at tighthead prop and Lourens Adriaanse moves to the bench.The halfback combination of Rudy Paige and Lambie are kept unchanged. Wing JP Pietersen returns to the side and will wear the No. 11 jersey, the position he usually plays for his club side, the Leicester Tigers.Ruan Combrinck will do duty on the right wing, and Willie le Roux at fullback, which means a return to the back three that played in the three-Test series against Ireland in June.#ENGvSA @Springboks team to face England at Twickenham this Saturday. pic.twitter.com/v1TfbADZwlCaptain Strauss will lead the Springboks for the tenth consecutive Test match, while lock Eben Etzebeth will play in his 31st consecutive Test for the Springboks.While England coach Eddie Jones has handed centre Elliot Daly a debut start for his run on XV for the clash against the Springboks, this means he will be Bok debutant Venter s direct opposition.England are unbeaten in 2016 under Jones and have made six changes, some injury enforced since their last Test in Australia.They have not beaten South Africa in 12 attempts since 2006 and will see Saturday as an ideal opportunity to do so.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
