Prophet Lethebo Rabalago is the latest so called pastor to shock people by using unconventional healing methods. JOHANENSBURG The Limpopo Health Department has advised congregants of the Mount Zion General Assembly Church to seek medical care if they were sprayed with Doom insect killer by the pastor.'Prophet' Lethebo Rabalago is the latest so called pastor to shock people by using unconventional healing methods after pictures of him spraying his followers with insecticide went viral on social media.The department has expressed concern saying he s preying on vulnerable people.The department is also working on a way to get the so called prophet to go for involuntary psychiatric assessment.MEC Dr. Phophi Ramathumba says, Our public health specialist is available to assist all those congregants who will want to come. At the same time, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistics Communities (CRL) said until a regulatory body is established for churches in South Africa, there is little that can be done to ensure that pastors using unconventional and harmful methods of healing can be held accountable.The CRL Rights Commission chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says in most instances the people who consume these harmful substances are consenting adults, which rules out the possibility of legal action. When they do this to adults, there is no law in the country that can stop them. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says it's important that the religious sector be formalised to avoid such incidents. We need to pass the regulation and legislation that we are proposing and that we believe can protect communities and congregants. The commission chairperson has stressed the importance of legislation to be created in order to protect vulnerable people from being victims of harmful religious practices.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
