NPA head Shaun Abrahams yesterday announced the withdrawal of the charges against Pravin Gordhan, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula. CAPE TOWN - Parliament s justice portfolio committee says it welcomes the decision by National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) chief Shaun Abrahams to withdraw charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials.Abrahams was questioned about the move when he briefed the committee earlier this month, the day after he held a press conference to announce the three had been summoned to appear in court on 2 November on fraud charges.In an embarrassing climbdown, Abrahams yesterday announced the withdrawal of the charges against Gordhan, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula, as plans gathered momentum for a massive show of support for the finance minister.Abrahams s highly publicised announcement about prosecuting the country s finance minister sent the rand plunging and wiped nearly R50 billion off the Johannesburg Stock Exchange s banking index.The alleged fraud involved a retirement package for Pillay of just over R1 million.A day later Abrahams told Parliament s justice committee he did not take the decision to prosecute Gordhan, Pillay and Magashula himself, and that he was prepared to review it if they asked him to do so.Gordhan held firm and delivered his medium-term budget policy statement in Parliament last week to standing ovations from members of Parliament.Justice committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga, in a statement issued on Monday, said he was pleased that Abrahams applied his mind and decided to withdraw the charges.WATCH: Now you see them, now you don't: NPA drops Gordhan charges(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
