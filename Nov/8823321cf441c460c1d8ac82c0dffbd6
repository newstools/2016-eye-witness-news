The cafe was opened in a bid to curb the scourge of drug abuse and unemployment among youth. CAPE TOWN - Sixty young people from disadvantaged communities have become the first graduates of a newly-established Western Cape skills development program.The Sozo Foundation, a NPO based in Vrygond along the Cape Flats, opened the Youth Caf for Young People Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) earlier this year. The cafe was opened in partnership with the provincial Social Development Department in a bid to curb the scourge of drug abuse and unemployment among youth.Sozo Youth Caf director Steve Morris says he is proud of the students growth. Up to 85 percent of the graduates, between the ages of 16 and 25, who initially entered the program successfully completed it. The Youth Caf is an opportunity for unemployed young people. They come through a six-month training scheme at the Youth Caf in various different skills and they re all given an opportunity to engage back into education, or further training or employment. During the graduation ceremony, 25-year-old Urafoan Walters, who's been training to be a barrista, received a message to say he landed a job at a popular coffee shop in Muizenberg.Walters, who lives in Capricorn, says this is the first time he's ever completed anything successfully. I found this experience amazing. In my life, going to school, trying to do more studies I never completed anything, and this is my first time I actually completed something!
