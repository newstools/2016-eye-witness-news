Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she hopes he will be able to serve in other structures. JOHANNESBURG Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has told Eyewitness News that people should not start accusing those implicated in the state of capture report of being guilty until the matter goes through a judicial process.Mkhwebane was speaking on the sidelines of the University of Limpopo student trust fund dinner at the Gallagher Convention Centre yesterday evening. She says it s a great loss for the public sector to have someone of Eskom CEO Brian Molefe s calibre leave its ranks.Mkhwebane has, however, urged those that people seek judicial review and not make haste judgments on those implicate in the report. All I can say is that people can lodge judicial review if they re not happy about the outcome of the report. So that s the most important thing which I would say to people I don t think it s justifiable for us or for people to start criticising or start thinking that people are guilty. Mkhwebane says she hopes he will be able to serve in other structures. I mean honestly it s a loss for the country. Yesterday, Molefe announced his resignation from the power utility effective from 1 January next year.MOLEFE S RESIGNATION REGRATTABLEEskom chair Ben Ngubane says the decision by Molefe to resign as the parastatal s CEO from January is regrettable but understandable.Last week, the Public Protector s report on state capture said it appeared Eskom had tried to push the Optimum Coal Mine into financial distress so the Gupta family could buy itIt also found that Molefe had been in regular contact with the Guptas at the time and regularly visited their Saxonworld home.Energy expert Chris Yellend says this resignation could be just the start as the full judicial inquiry into claims of state capture is still to come. I do think that there s going to be a lot of dirty washing, a lot of new facts coming out. We ve not seen half of it in my opinion. But Eskom s board says it wants to thank Molefe for his dedication to turning the utility around and putting it on a sound growth trajectory.Molefe says that he is going to dedicate himself showing that he is the victim of injustice because the Public Protector s observations were published after an incomplete investigation.BROWN SADDENED BY RESIGNATIONPublic Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said she is saddened by the resignation of Molefe but respects his decision.Minister Brown said Molefe has been instrumental in developing Eskom s turnaround strategy and it s disappointing that he won t be around to see it completed.She said she will work closely with the Eskom board to ensure that the company remains stable but says that Molefe leaves a strong executive.The Public Enterprises Minister said that during Molefe s tenure, Eskom managed to connect almost 100,000 houses to the grid with overall revenue increasing.Added to this, she said there have been 460 days with no load shedding.Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance has announced it will be laying charges against Molefe in terms of the Prevention and Combatting of Corruption Act.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
