It&#8217;s understood Phahlane is accused of defeating the ends of justice for allegedly interfering with witnesses. JOHANNESBURG It s emerged the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) will today obtain a warning statement from acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane in a case related to defeating the ends of justice. It s alleged that Phahlane interfered with witnesses during an investigation into the construction of his luxury house in an upmarket estate in the north of Pretoria. Private investigator Paul O'Sullivan opened the case against Phahlane almost a year ago. Ipid and the general s spokesperson have both declined to officially confirm that he is scheduled to provide the warning statement. An Ipid investigator with knowledge of the case against Phahlane says he is expected to provide a warning statement today. He says a decision on whether to charge Phahlane will depend on the contents of his statement. O'Sullivan claims that the general lives in a house valued at about R8 million, but the value of his bond is far lower, and it appears he only paid R2.2 million for it. It is understood that Phahlane allegedly interfered with witnesses who were being questioned in relation to that investigation. Ipid has declined to comment on the matter, while the police have denied any knowledge of the investigation.
