However, for the eastern part of the country, Mpumalanga and Limpopo we do have a chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon and rainfall along the escarpment area. Meanwhile, Gauteng dwellers will have some relief as the water levels at the Vaal Dam have increased from 26.5 percent recorded on Friday to 27.7 percent.This comes as a result of continuous rain at the dam s water catchment areas.The Department of Water and Sanitation says they are far from their targeted 50 percent.The department is urging Johannesburg residents to use water sparingly.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
