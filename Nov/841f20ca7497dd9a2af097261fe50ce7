GP Human Settlements Department says it is identifying land where a temporary camp for Alexandra residents can be built. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Human Settlements Department says while it is in the process of supplying temporary housing for those affected by the floods in Alexandra, it cannot guarantee that everyone will be permanently accommodated.Spokesperson Keith Khoza says the department is in the process of identifying land where a temporary camp can be built. We have now taken a decision that we will evacuate people in that area, find an alternative area to locate them and fence it off so that nobody can go and stay in that area. He says while it is the department s duty to ensure all residents are taken to safety, it cannot provide permanent free housing for those who are not South Africans. The department does not give everybody housing, it has to be people who qualify; some of them are not South African nationals and cannot benefit from the RDP housing. Khoza has urged all those affected to come forward and receive assistance.At the same time, the Cooperative Governance Department is urging communities to be cautious during the latest spate of severe storms to avoid any more deaths. Emergency services say six people died in Gauteng yesterday as a result of the heavy rains.A three-year-old child who was swept away during a torrent in Alexandra is still missing.The department says teams are on the ground in hot spot areas as a precaution with more heavy downpours expected in the coming hours. We are calling on communities to always make sure that they take care of themselves and their families to ensure that we don t have fatalities like we did yesterday.
