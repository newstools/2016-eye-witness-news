An inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation&#8217;s board is set to begin today. JOHANNESBURG The inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board is set to begin today with news that two more board members have resigned.The Parliamentary ad hoc committee set up to conduct the inquiry will discuss if the board is still fit to do its job. It s emerged Nomvuyo Mhlakaza and Aaron Tshidzumba tendered their resignations at the weekend.That means chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe is the only non-executive member left.The committee was appointed by the National Assembly and has until January to decide on the board s future.Multiple resignations earlier this year had left the board with just three remaining members, while it needed nine to form a quorum.Three board members resigned after former CEO Hlaudi Motsoeneng was reinstated in a senior management role in September.But earlier this month, Communications Minister Faith Muthambi told Parliament that the public broadcaster s board was functional and could take decisions with only three members.But now only one remains.The SABC says it can t comment on the matter because it doesn t make board appointments.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
