Robert McBride says there is a concerted effort from elements within the Hawks &amp; the NPA to cripple key State institutions. JOHANNESBURG - Police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride says a judicial enquiry should be setup to investigate the State of the criminal justice system and establish the motives behind what he believes are malicious prosecutions.He was speaking outside the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Tuesday where the State had earlier withdrawn all charges against him and subordinates Innocent Khuba and Matthews Sesoko.State drops charges against Ipid head Robert McBride https://t.co/2KdP8k7KHL pic.twitter.com/DX61UwSPS6McBride and the investigators were accused of altering a report to clear former Hawks bosses Anwa Dramat and Shadrack Sibiya of their involvement in a 2010 rendition case. The collapse of the case against McBride a day after prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams announced the withdrawal of charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.McBride has called for a high-level and independent investigation into the state of the criminal justice system. Perhaps it requires a judicial commission of inquiry. How is it possible that a few elements in the criminal justice system can go ahead meticulously and continuously making the independent institutions and watchdog bodies to be toothless? The court heard that the State s witnesses, including the attorney who authored the report which implicated McBride, refused to testify because they believed their evidence was inadmissible. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) reacted by simply saying that after consulting witnesses it realised it would not have been able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.McBride says there is a concerted effort from elements within the Hawks and the NPA to cripple key State institutions. Certain elements of the Hawks and the NPA are conspiring to make up trumped up charges against people play an important role in institutions of our country. It emerged in court that the author of the report, which formed the basis of the prosecution, refused to testify. It s unclear why it has taken the attorney 18 months since he signed it off to formally distance himself from its findings.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
