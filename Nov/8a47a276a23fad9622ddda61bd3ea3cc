EFF leader Julius Malema told his followers that he was not calling for the slaughter of white people - yet. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says there will never be enough context to justify Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema s recent remarks regarding white people.During a public meeting outside a court in Newcastle, Malema told his followers that he was not calling for the slaughter of white people - yet.He also said land should be taken from whites without compensation. The DA says it will now report him to the South African Human Rights Commission.The party s Phumzile Van Damme said: There s never any context that would justify saying you are not yet planning on genocide. There s absolutely no space in our constitutional democracy for such talk. Malema, undeterred, said his party is on a mission to disturb the white man s peace, saying they found peaceful Africans and killed them like animals. We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now. He sent out this warning: But white minority be warned, we will take our land no matter what. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
