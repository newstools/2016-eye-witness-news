The North West ANC says it believes Gaasite Legalatladi, who appeared in court on Monday, didn&#8217;t plan the murder alone. JOHANNESBURG The North West African National Congress (ANC) says it wants the former councillor suspected of plotting to kill Premier Supra Mahumapelo in November 2014 to reveal the rest of her accomplices so they can be charged.ANC s Dakota Legoete says it is clear that former councillor Gaasite Legalatladi didn t plan the murder alone and she should not allow herself to bear the brunt alone.Legalatladi appeared before a packed Lehurutshe Magistrates Court on Monday, her case has been postponed to May next year.It is alleged that video evidence of the plot will be played in court on her next appearance and two prominent government officials will take the stand as witnesses.Legoete says they believe the former councillor plotted to kill the premier because she was not elected to be mayor. It would be important for her to declare who else is a co-conspirator in this particular action, so that we can bring serious remedial action against all those involved because it s clear they are members of the ANC. But secondly, it s wrong to plan the death of your leadership only because of your personal interest. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
