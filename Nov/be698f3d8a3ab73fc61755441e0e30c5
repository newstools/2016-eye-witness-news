The ANC says the Public Protector's report makes no findings and says it&#8217;s observations are inconclusive. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign on the basis of the State of Capture report are premature and unfounded.The party was briefing the media in Johannesburg following its national working committee meeting.The report reveals that Zuma failed to act on claims of state capture and that the Gupta family may have known about Des Van Rooyen's appointment as Finance Minister before Nhlanhla Nene was axed in December.It's been recommended that a commission of inquiry be instituted. ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says while issues raised in the State of Capture report are serious, the report makes no findings and says it s observations are inconclusive. It contains no binding findings, referring to guilt of any party. The Public Protector s report rather calls for an establishment of a commission of inquiry. He says the report cannot be used to justify calls for the president to resign. Calls for the stepping down of the president, using the report as the basis thereof, as far as we are concerned are premature and unfounded. The party says as a matter of principle, it supports the inquiry in the allegations of state capture but says it must be established like any other judicial inquiry.Read the Public Protector's full 'State of Capture' report below: State Capture Report 2016 by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
