Several dams and reservoirs in the province are running low this weekend. JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Water says if residents continue to flout water regulations, the city could soon move to stage 3 regulations.The Department of Water and Sanitation recently announced it will be cutting water supply to all Gauteng municipalities, due to a lack of willingness by consumers to save water.Johannesburg is currently under level two water restrictions, which means residents are not allowed to water their gardens between 6am and 6pm, fill pools with municipal water or wash cars using a hosepipe.Joburg Water's Tidimalo Chuene says: There are elements of rationing. It means you supply water to area A, while restricting water to area B. When you re satisfied you ll move to the next area. However, there are serious challenges in going that route. Water supply from the Vaal Dam is running low and several reservoirs, including the Lenasia high level and Alexander Park reservoirs, have also been affected.Chuene says technicians are working around the clock to stabilise the system. We are still struggling with the Lenasia reservoir and request residents to reduce consumption. Other areas that are affected are around Alexander Park and Meadowlands. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
