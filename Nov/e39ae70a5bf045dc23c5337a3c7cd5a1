The term - which refers to the weight of Kim Jong Un, his father and grandfather - was last blocked in September. SHANGHAI - Chinese websites have again blocked searches for Fatty Kim the Third , as many Chinese mockingly call North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with China s foreign ministry saying it did not approve of ridiculing foreign leaders.Chinese internet users began reporting last week that searches on the Twitter-like microblogging site Weibo and search engine Baidu for the expression returned no results, the normal sign that something is being blocked despite its wide usage.The term - which refers to the weight of Kim, his father and grandfather - was last blocked in September after neighbouring North Korea s latest nuclear test.Kim is unpopular in China because of his country s repeated nuclear and missile tests.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said reports the government had banned the search term did not accord with the facts . What I want to stress is that China has always dedicated itself to constructing a rational, cultured and healthy environment for public opinion, Geng told a daily news briefing.China does not approve of insulting or ridiculing language to address any country s leader , he added, without elaborating.Both Baidu Inc and Sina Corp, which owns Weibo, declined to comment.China s internet regulator did not respond to a request for comment.Many Chinese, however, took to Weibo to suggest multiple other terms which sound similar to Fatty Kim the Third and which are not blocked.
