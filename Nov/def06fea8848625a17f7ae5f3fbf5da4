The statement from 10 Downing Street paints a picture of two world leaders committing to strengthening ties. LONDON - The office of British Prime Minister Theresa May has confirmed that she has spoken to America s new President Donald Trump in a telephone call that has led to some controversy.The two nations have a so-called special relationship and Trump's victory has been widely compared to the Brexit vote in the UK. On Wednesday, May congratulated Trump on becoming president and said she is looking forward to working with him and his administration. The statement from 10 Downing Street paints a picture of two world leaders congratulating each other on their appointments and committing to strengthening ties. During the phone call, May picked up on Trump's acceptance speech and his promise to unite America, a task Britain is also faced with following the Brexit referendum. With both countries out to secure better trade deals, there will be much to discuss in coming months and Trump has already invited May over for a visit. But in a twist, Trump appears to have spoken to the leaders of nine other countries including Turkey and South Korea, and had issued a Saint Patrick s Day invitation to Ireland before contacting May - sparking questions about his priorities.
