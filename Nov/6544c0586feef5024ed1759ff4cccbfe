ANC MPs whose absence prevented the passage of a crucial budget bill this week will be hauled before a disciplinary committee, chief whip Jackson Mthembu said. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) whose absence without leave prevented the passage of a crucial Budget Bill this week will be hauled before a disciplinary committee.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu made the announcement on Thursday.He says the party caucus decided unanimously at its meeting on Wednesday morning that the MPs who are absent without leave must face the consequences.The Division of Revenue Amendme nt Bill could not be passed when it came before the National Assembly on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday, because there were not enough MPS in the Chamber.Mthembu says while the absence of Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters MPs didn t help, the ANC could have managed the 201 votes needed to pass the Bill on its own and takes full responsibility. The absence of these MPs, despite recorded confirmation that they would be present is disgraceful and downright disrespectful to the people of South Africa MPs who were not among 40 given leave of absence will now appear before an ANC caucus disciplinary committee chaired by Mathole Motshekga. Caucus has unanimously agreed that there must be consequences. Mthembu says it s the first time draft legislation has been brought before the house twice and still failed to muster enough votes to pass.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
