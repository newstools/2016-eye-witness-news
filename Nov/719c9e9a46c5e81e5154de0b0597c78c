It&#8217;s emerged the SACP said it was a mistake for the ANC to use President Zuma as the symbol of its local election campaign. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) says it will continue to engage with the South African Communist Party (SACP), after it emerged the communist party had said it was a mistake for the ANC to use President Jacob Zuma as the symbol of its local election campaign.The SACP also asked where else in the world would a party choose to build its campaign around a deeply flawed personality cult.The comments are contained in a discussion document compiled by its central committee, and published in the African Communist .The party says the ANC should not have used President Zuma as the face of its campaign, as his approval numbers are much lower than that of the party.But the governing party s Khusela Sangoni says the party is entitled to its own view. Issues such as these that the SACP wishes to raise, we trust that they would bring them to the meetings of the alliance which take place regularly. The SACP has recently strongly criticised Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the Gupta family and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
