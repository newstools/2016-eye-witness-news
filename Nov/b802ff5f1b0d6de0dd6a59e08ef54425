SACP leader Blade Nzimande has accused the Gupta family of undermining South Africa's hard won democracy. JOHANNESBURG South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande has lashed out at the Gupta family accusing them of undermining South Africa's hard won democracy.Nzimande was speaking at the communist party's Red October campaign in Sebokeng this afternoon.The Public Protector's State of Capture report has revealed that President Jacob Zuma failed to investigate claims that the controversial family may have known in advance that Des van Rooyen would become finance minister last December.The investigation has also uncovered that Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane possibly broke the Constitution by helping the family land a mining deal.Nzimande says the Gupta's are no alternative to monopoly capital. We have illustrious families in South Africa like the Mandela family, Sisulu family, the Kathrada s who have no culture of entitlement. Why does this family feel like they have a culture of entitlement in South Africa to do as they please?
