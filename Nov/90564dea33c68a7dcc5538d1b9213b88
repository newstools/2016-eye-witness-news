Democrats have filed a flurry of last minute law suits, alleging voter intimidation by Trump supporters. NEW YORK On the day of the presidential election, state officials say they are preparing for an unusual level of confusion and chaos, as voters cast their ballots in a historically bitter race.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump gave their final speeches at rallies in swing states, crucial battlegrounds needed to win the 270 number of Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.Democrats have filed a flurry of last minute law suits, alleging voter intimidation by Trump supporters and there have been some heated polling site confrontations between Trump voters and Clinton backers.Election monitors are especially worried this year about voter intimidation after calls made by Trump for his supporters to stake out polling places and watch for fraud.But it remains unclear how widespread the threat of voter intimidation will be or if it will materialise. We choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America, Clinton said in Philadelphia before a crowd of 33,000, the biggest of her campaign.She was joined by Democratic President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle, and Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton.Trump made one of his final appearances late on Monday in Manchester, New Hampshire, where polls showed a tight race. Tomorrow, the American working class will strike back, Trump said. It s about time. He brought much of his family on stage for his last rally in the state where he scored his first victory in the Republican nomination fight.FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENTClinton went into Election Day as the favorite to become the first US woman president after spending eight years in the White House as the first lady in the 1990s.A Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll gave Clinton a 90 percent chance of defeating Trump and said she was on track to win 303 Electoral College votes out of 270 needed, to Trump s 235.But Trump advisers said the level of his support was not apparent in the polling and believed the New York businessman was in position for an upset victory along the lines of the Brexit vote in June to pull Britain from the European Union. We have seen enormous momentum, said deputy Trump campaign manager Dave Bossie.Financial markets brightened in reaction to the latest twists in what has been a volatile presidential campaign. Global stock markets and the US dollar surged, putting them on track for their biggest gains in weeks.Investors, who see Clinton as a known quantity, were buoyed by an announcement on Sunday by FBI Director James Comey that cleared Clinton of a cloud of controversy involving her use of a private email server while President Barack Obama s secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.While opinion polls showed a close race, but tilting toward Clinton, major bookmakers and online exchanges were more confident of a Clinton victory. PredictIt put her chances of capturing the White House at 81 percent.Both Clinton and Trump planned to vote on Tuesday, she in Chappaqua, New York, and he in Manhattan. They were then to hold victory rallies about a mile apart in the evening in New York City.EYES ON FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINAAn early indicator of the strength of each candidate could come in North Carolina and Florida, two must-win states for Trump that have been the subject of frantic last-minute efforts by both the Republican and Democratic campaigns.Races in both those states were shifting from favoring Clinton to being too close to call.A strong vote for Clinton could jeopardize Republican control of the US Senate, as voters choose 34 senators of the 100-member chamber. Democrats needed a net gain of five seats to win control. The 435-seat House of Representatives was expected, however, to remain in Republican hands.Voters had to choose between Clinton, who was vowed to largely continue the policies of Democrat Obama, and Trump, who has never held public office and has positioned himself as a change agent. Both were viewed unfavorably by majorities of voters.The long-running US election campaign has been one of the most negative in American history with each candidate accusing the other of lacking the character and judgment to be president.Trump, a former reality TV star, reveled in the drama and seized the spotlight time and again with provocative comments about Muslims and women, attacks against the Republican establishment and bellicose appeals to build a wall along the US southern border with Mexico to stem illegal immigration.But the spotlight was not always kind to Trump, with the release of a 2005 video in which he boasted about groping women damaging his campaign and leaving him on the defensive for critical weeks.Clinton, a former US senator with a penchant for secrecy, sustained damaging blows of her own linked to her handling of classified information as the country s top diplomat. FBI Director James Comey shook up the race and slowed her momentum with an 28 October announcement the agency was reviewing newly discovered emails that might pertain to her email practices.On Sunday, Comey told Congress that investigators had found no reason to change their July finding that there was no criminal wrongdoing in Clinton s use of the server.Additional information by Reuters(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
