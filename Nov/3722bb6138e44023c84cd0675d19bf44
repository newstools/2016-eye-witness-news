Dlamini says the university should consider the psychological impact of the protests on students. JOHANNESBURG - Former Wits University SRC president Mcebo Dlamini says varsity management should take into account what students have been through over the past few months and students should be allowed to write exams next year. Students and police have repeatedly clashed during the nationwide #FeesMustFall protests, with many being arrested and injured.Dlamini, who was released on bail on Wednesday, says the university should consider the psychological impact of the protests on students. Allow those who can write now, to write and those who feel they ve been traumatised or affected by what has transpired in the past two months to write in January. Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel says the university is more than willing to find a long lasting solution. Engagement with student leaders will continue into next week. We all agreed that these issues must be resolved as a matter of urgency. Student leaders say that the current situation is not conducive to studying and students need more time.WATCH: Mcebo Dlamini released on bailWATCH] Mcebo Dlamini released on bail(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
