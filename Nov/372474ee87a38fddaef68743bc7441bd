JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the number of pupils who ve been hospitalised after eating sweets in the south of Johannesburg has now risen to about 60. Earlier, pupils from Suid Heuwels Primary, and at least two other surrounding schools, were rushed to hospital after complaining of stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. It s understood the pupils all ate sweets given to them by an unknown man yesterday.Why will an adult try to &#39;poison or drug&#39; hundreds of kids at school nogal #Heartless! Be well my kids, Papa love you so much!Lesufi says the majority of the children will be discharged soon. The pupils are in four different hospitals. I went to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital and found that only two learners needed further attention, the others are recovering well. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
