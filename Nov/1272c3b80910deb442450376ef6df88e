Noah has driven taxis, sold CDs, and been a DJ, but says he's always wanted to write a book. NEW YORK Trevor Noah can now add the role of author to his CV. The South African comedian, who hosts Comedy Central s The Daily Show, has just released his debut book, called Born a Crime . Noah has driven taxis, sold CDs, and been a DJ, but says he's always wanted to write a book. I knew I didn t want to write a memoir, it feels like you re saying I m done but I don t feel I ve even started. He started writing the collection of stories about his upbringing in South Africa even before he was announced as The Daily Show host. There s things I tell people that I can t tell on stage because it just doesn t work for comedy. The book will also be available in the United States.Had a great time on @CBSThisMorning talking about #bornacrime Thanks @charlierose @GayleKing and @NorahODonnell for having me on! pic.twitter.com/D86w0CfGnk
