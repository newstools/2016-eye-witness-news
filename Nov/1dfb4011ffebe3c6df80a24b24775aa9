Eskom chair Baldwin Ngubane says he&#8217;s taken aback by suggestions that the board should be dissolved. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom chairperson Baldwin Ngubane said on Thursday that it would be absurd for the utility s board to be dissolved due to what he called a speculative report by the former public protector.During an interim results briefing at Megawatt Park, Ngubane said the board was satisfied that it had complied with all its legal obligations and that it stood by CEO Brian Molefe.After delays and legal wrangling Advocate Thuli Madonsela s 355-page report was released on Wednesday and is scathing of the conduct of Eskom and Molefe.It shows that the state utility appears to have made certain deals with Gupta-owned Tegeta to put the Optimum Coal mine out of business.Ngubane said Eskom is where it is today, with surplus electricity supply and no load shedding for over a year, due to first rate leadership from Molefe.He said the State of Capture report was speculative and he was taken aback by suggestions that the board should be dissolved. This is ridiculous and crazy. Look at the facts; to just shout that the Eskom board should be dissolved without a hearing is crazy. Molefe maintained that the allegations levelled against him were unfounded and that he wasn t given an opportunity to explain to Madonsela the reasoning behind a R600 million pre-payment to Tegeta.He became emotional towards the end of the briefing and walked off stage.Another briefing was expected to be held on Friday to discuss more aspects of the report.
