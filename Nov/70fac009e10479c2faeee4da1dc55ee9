The federation is holding a media briefing following its central executive committee meeting. JOHANNESBURG The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it has thrown its support behind African National Congress (ANC) deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma.The federation is holding a media briefing following its central executive committee meeting.It all started at Cosatu's national congress last year when the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) proposed that Cosatu throw its support behind Ramaphosa, saying it was a matter of principle that the deputy president eventually became president.But Cosatu reprimanded the unions and warned them against discussing who should be elected president of the ANC until the party opened its succession debate. And then more unions joined the call to back Ramaphosa, including the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu).Cosatu's general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says a decision has now been made.&quot;After intensive and robust debate the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the ANC, comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, to take over the reigns as the next president of the ANC.&quot;He says they also support the proposal that the ANC should explore the possibility of avoiding slates and contestation in its next conference next year.
