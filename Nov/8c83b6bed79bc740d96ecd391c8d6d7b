Proceedings in the legislature were adjourned earlier today and security was called to remove an EFF member. JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has accused Gauteng Provincial Legislature Speaker Ntombi Mekgwe of being biased and favouring the African National Congress (ANC) after she suspended one of the party's Member of Provincial Legislature from attending next week s sitting.Proceedings were adjourned earlier today and security was called to remove an EFF member from the house.MECs were answering questions from opposition parties today. As she answered questions on behalf of a colleague, Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza repeatedly told EFF MPLs to shut up inside the Chamber.During the hackling EFF MPL Christinah Mabala then called Mayathula-Khoza a straatmeid and when Mekgwe asked her to withdraw, Mabala and her fellow EFF members refused to do so.Mekgwe then told the house that she is suspending Mabala from attending next week s proceedings.But the EFF s Mandisa Mashigo stood up, told Mekgwe that she is being unfair and is not fit to hold her position. The Speaker is very fast to remind us of unparliamentary language but when it is used by members of the ANC caucus, the Speaker does not apply the same stringent rules. Now this is biased. Mekgwe then told Mayathula-Khoza to withdraw telling EFF members to shut up .(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
