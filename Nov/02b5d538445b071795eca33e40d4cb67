NPA head Shaun Abraham says the Sars investigation unit case has not yet been concluded. PRETORIA - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is off the hook on fraud charges, but he may still be implicated in the South African Revenue Service (Sars) investigation unit case.National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams announced yesterday charges against Gordhan and two former Sars officials, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula, have been dropped.The advocate says that after studying representations, he found the three lacked the requisite intention to act unlawfully in relation to an early retirement package for Pillay, which had been approved by Gordhan.Abrahams says the Sars investigation unit case has not yet been concluded. I have been advised the investigation is still continuing. Hopefully the investigating team will tie up the investigation soonest and the NPA will be in a position to make a decision. Abrahams was critical of the way the fraud case was handled, which may affect future dealings between Gordhan and the Hawks. This matter could have been easily clarified had there been proper engagement and cooperation between the Hawks and Mr Magashula, Mr Pillay and Minister Gordhan. Gordhan and the implicated Sars officials have always denied any wrongdoing in the establishment of the Sars investigating unit.Meanwhile, Abrahams has been slammed for his handling on the case.The Law Society of South Africa says he brought the legal fraternity into disrepute, damaging the economy in the process.The organisation's Mvuzo Notyetsi says: This is a conscious call on his part, the entire country has been put into an unnecessary panic. South Africa has been brought into disrepute. If one consciously looks back and reflects on this matter, he has to consider his position. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
