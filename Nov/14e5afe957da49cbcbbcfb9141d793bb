CAPE TOWN A pastor from Kraaifontein, accused of raping a child in 1970, says bringing the case to court decades later is unnecessary.The 77-year-old grandfather maintains his innocence, saying the church would have acted against him if he was guilty.He was testifying in the Parow Magistrates Court where the matter has been postponed until the end of the month.The pastor says he s baffled by the rape charges brought by a woman who claims he raped her twice when she was eight.The woman claims she was first raped after the accused offered to take her home from school in 1970.She says the accused also raped her during a church gathering in Oudtshoorn later that year.Two senior members of the Emmanuel Pentecostal Mission Church on Thursday took to the stand to dispute the victim s version of events.The matter has been postponed to 30 November to give the defence time to call a third witness from Gauteng.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
