Minimum wage advisory panel chairperson Imraan Valodia says experts looked at local surveys focusing on South Africans' earnings. CAPE TOWN The national minimum wage advisory panel chairperson says that some fellow panelists argued over some issues before agreeing on a figure it believes represents a middle ground.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the panel's proposed amount on Sunday of R3,500 per month. The proposal has now been put out for public comment.Advisory panel chairperson Imraan Valodia says experts looked at local surveys focusing on South Africans' earnings. From the sort of picture that comes out, it s sort of striking. About 47% of those who do work in South Africa, earn a wage below R3,500. He adds that members had opposing views after studying the possible effects of a national minimum wage. There is one view that at the types of advicethat we set, there is likely to be some amount of job losses and on the other hand there is evidence that predicts we are not going to have job losses. Valodia believes the proposed figure is a fair middle ground that poses less of a risk to job losses.LISTEN: Labour analyst Terry Bell shares his thoughts about the proposed minimum wage(Edited by Neo Koza)
