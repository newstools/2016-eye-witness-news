They managed to give Nigeria a headache for the most part of the game.Coach Desiree Ellis s side squandered numerous chances in front of the goal that could have seen them walk away comfortable winners, something that was bemoaned by the interim boss. Once again we didn t convert our chances and that is the name of the game. But South Africa can be proud of Banyana Banyana. We came and we played, we fought hard and I think the game could have gone either way.
