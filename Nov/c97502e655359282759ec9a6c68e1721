FUL and the HSF says President Zuma has given no indication when the decision to suspend NPA head Shaun Abrahams will actually be taken. JOHANNESBURG Freedom Under Law (FUL) and the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) say they are going ahead with their urgent court application to force National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams's suspension despite President Jacob Zuma having written to him giving him notice of his intention to suspend. The civic rights groups want Abrahams and fellow prosecutors Sibongile Mzinyathi and Torie Pretorius to be suspended over their handling of the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. FUL and the HSF says the president has given no indication when the decision to suspend Abrahams will actually be taken. They say it seems that the president intends to draw out and delay the process unnecessarily and unlawfully and it is clear that the he will not meet the 21 November deadline which he gave to the civic rights groups. The organisations say that with public confidence in the NPA in tatters and threats of fresh charges against the Finance Minister being mulled, a further delay by the president has the potential to be catastrophic. They are going ahead with the application they say, to vindicate the requirement of lawful and rational government conduct and to uphold the public interest.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
