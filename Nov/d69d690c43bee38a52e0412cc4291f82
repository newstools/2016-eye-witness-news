JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) NEC member Malusi Gigaba says counter-revolutionary forces, including the media, are trying to destroy the ANC.Gigaba was speaking at the National Union of Mineworkers national youth structure conference in Pretoria on Friday.The ANC leadership has been criticised for its handling of various issues including the Nkandla scandal, state capture and the fees crisis at the country's universities.Gigaba says there is a capitalist agenda at play that is targeting the ruling party. When you open newspapers today, watch the news or listen to the radio you are led to believe that the biggest and most real problem in South Africa is the ANC, and in order to save South Africa you need to defeat or destroy it. Gigaba has also warned against the revolutionary movement sliding into the terrain of being a common party.He says factions within the ANC are derailing the vision of the entire movement. Our collective challenge at the present moment is to defeat these factions completely. Gigaba has called on youth not to get held up in factional battles, but to work to revive the ANC back to its ideological position.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
