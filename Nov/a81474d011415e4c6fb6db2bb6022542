We listened to each other very carefully. We gave each other time to talk and say anything we wanted to say, as ANC members - all of us in that room. ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says they discussed how best the veterans can contribute in making the ANC a better organisation. These comrades are bringing a wealth of experience to us to be able to go through these difficult periods and be a better organisation. The stalwarts have proposed that the party holds a consultative conference to rebuild and renew the movement - something the ANC hasn't ruled out and has promised to discuss further.(Edited by Neo Koza)
