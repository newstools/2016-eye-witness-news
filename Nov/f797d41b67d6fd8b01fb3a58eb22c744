Minister David Mahlobo denies that he knows or is friends with the Chinese national linked to rhino poaching. PRETORIA State Security Minister David Mahlobo has appealed to the police to investigate him to establish if he does indeed have any links to rhino poachers, as alleged in an Al Jazeeraexpose. The minister issued the request at an Institute for Security Studies seminar on violent protests in Pretoria earlier on Monday. The call follows the Al Jazeera investigation, in which a Chinese national with links to rhino horn and ivory smugglers claimed to know Mahlobo, and produced a photo of the two of them together. The Chinese national is the owner of an Mbombela spa where the minister visits allegedly for massages and manicures.

If you read thing yesterday, the man never said I m a friend, he says he knows me. How does he know me? I visit a spa treatment. Is it a crime to visit one? He has asked the Mpumalanga police commissioner to investigate the allegations. I am not above the law, I have said let them investigate. If I happen to do criminal activities, I am prepared to face the music. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance has asked President Jacob Zuma to place Mahlobo on special leave to ensure a proper investigation is conducted.LISTEN: David Mahlobo denies criminal rhino poaching connection(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
