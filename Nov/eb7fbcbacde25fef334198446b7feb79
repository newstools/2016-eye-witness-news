We ve been in a similar position before where we went to Equatorial Guinea, the stadium was packed and we had about five fans. We had the belief that we could win that game, which we did. We have that belief yet again and we have to go out onto the field and do the job. Ellis and her girls will be hoping that Zimbabwe don t get a result against Egypt, so as to ease the pressure on them, should things not go as planned.
