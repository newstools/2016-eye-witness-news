The boy was found hanged at his New Crossroads home on Friday morning. JOHANNESBURG Police are investigating the death of a 10-year-old boy who was found hanged in his yard in New Crossroads in Cape Town.It s believed the child took his life on Friday morning.The South African Depression and Anxiety Group s Tracy Feinstein, says the incident highlights the need for a lot more awareness around child suicide. For youngsters, often what we find is some of the warning signs are that often the children start withdrawing, so you start to see behaviour change [like] perhaps going to the bedroom from school. Feinstein says there are always warning signs. When we look back, there s often an experience of the person who is really feeling sad or lonely. It s as if they have been exposed to bullying, whether it be the physical bullying or the cyber bullying on social media it s an extremely difficult thing to talk about it.
