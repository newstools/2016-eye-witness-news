JOHANNESBURG Consumers have been advised to be their own &quot;Groupon&quot; and shop around for specials following the popular website's shut down.Groupon has been offering discounted deals since 2010 and this week announced its termination of operations in South Africa.However, the popular website says all current vouchers bought will remain valid until the date stated on the purchase.Head of online Insurance and Financial Comparison website Derek Wilson says Groupon s closure in South Africa is a shame for consumers. Especially because the South African economy has become more stretched and every rand counts. Wilson advises consumers to always compare prices. Shop around and get at least three quotes when shopping for anything.
