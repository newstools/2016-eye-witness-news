Sars approached the Constitutional Court over its decision to fire an employee who called his supervisor the k-word. JOHANNESBURG The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says it chose to take a principled stand against racism when it approached the Constitutional Court over its decision to fire an employee who called his supervisor the k-word.Jacobus Kruger called his boss Abel Mboweni the k-word in August 2007, saying his racist outburst was due to stress.He was handed a final warning, suspended for 10 days and had to go for counselling following a disciplinary hearing but the then Sars boss Pravin Gordhan wasn t satisfied with the sanction and dismissed Kruger.Kruger took the matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), where he won, but Sars continued defending its decision, eventually ending up in the highest court in the land.Sars lost its subsequent appeals in the Labour Court before arguing the case at the Constitutional Court.Yesterday, the court ruled that Kruger being reinstated would be unreasonable and must be set aside.The court said Sars was justified in firing Kruger, maintaining that the revenue service cannot be expected to retain an employee it has lost faith and confidence in.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said this kind of conduct must be met with a firm response if the country ever hopes to remove racism.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
