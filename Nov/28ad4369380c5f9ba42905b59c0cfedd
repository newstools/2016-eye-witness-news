Residents are urged to approach the police if they suspect they were scammed by undertakers. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has urged residents to approach the police if they suspect they were scammed while exhuming a loved one.The City's health directorate says it's received a number of reports that undertakers charge families an additional fee to secure the attendance of an environmental health practitioner at the exhumation.Mayco member for city health Siyabulela Mamkeli says this is supposed to be a free service.He has called on members of the public to familiarise themselves with the costs and processes around exhumation. All the information is available from City Parks or the city s website. I d like to encourage residents to lay charges with police because this is fraud. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
