Save SA says it is encouraged by voices in the leadership of the ANC who agree that President Jacob Zuma must go. JOHANNESBURG - Civil rights group Save South Africa has called on the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies to join the movement by ensuring that Jacob Zuma doesn t finish his term as president, saying he s broken the bond of trust with South Africans.The group launched the people s motion of no confidence against Zuma earlier today. It says it is encouraged by voices in the leadership of the ANC who agree that Zuma must go.Save SA convener Sipho Pityana said: The Save South Africa campaign recognizes that the ANC and its allies have an opportunity and a responsibility to put the country first. It has never been more urgent that the they should do so; the time to act, we urge them, is now. Save SA is urging all South Africans to show their support for this campaign by wearing the Save SA doeks, bandanas and armbands and by signing the people s motion of no confidence which is on the organisation s website.It also wants the public to organise silent protests wherever President Zuma speaks.Save SA is warning if the President is allowed to continue as head of state any longer, there won t be a country left to save by 2019.Pityana says Zuma has done enough damage. Whether is it Nkandla, Waterkloof Airbase, Denel, Eskom, SAA, the NPA, the Hawks, Sars or indeed reputed plots to undermine the National Treasury. He says after collecting signatures across the country on the motion of no confidence against the President, the organisation will hand over the petition to Parliament. We urge the National Assembly to hear the people s motion and to act on is mandate by dealing with Zuma s failures to respect his oath of office. The civil society group believes the president is a serious threat to the county's economic stability, the interests of the poor and the constitutional principle of social justice.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
