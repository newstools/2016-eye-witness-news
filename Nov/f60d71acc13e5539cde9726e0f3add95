A longer detention requires an arrest warrant issued by a court.Choi begged forgiveness when she arrived to meet prosecutors earlier on Monday.In an interview with South Korea s Segye Ilbo newspaper published on Thursday, Choi said she received drafts of Park s speeches after Park s election victory but denied she had access to other official material, or that she influenced state affairs or benefited financially.Park said last week she had given Choi access to speech drafts early in her term and apologised for causing concern among the public.Thousands of South Koreans rallied in Seoul on Saturday night demanding Park s resignation over the scandal.
