He was never taken to the Steve Biko Hospital and we ve ascertained that with the ambulances. They took him to the Tshwane district, which is one of our hospitals. News about Moutlana came to light after Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba tweeted about the accident and said the man was knocked over by President Jacob Zuma s motorcade, a statement which the Presidency has denied.Mahlangu says Mashaba should get his facts right first before going to the media. Mashaba shouldn t use politics to play with people s lives. She has sent condolences to Moutlana s family.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
