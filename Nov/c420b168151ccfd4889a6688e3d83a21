Professor William Gumede says recent protests including Fees Must Fall demonstrations are indicative of a new era of voters. JOHANNESBURG - Wits University Professor William Gumede says the African National Congress (ANC)'s failure to be accountable to its voters could lead to its demise. Gumede was speaking at the annual State of Democracy debate at Liliesleaf Farm in Johannesburg on Tuesday. He says the recent protests including the Fees Must Fall demonstrations are indicative of a new era of voters.Gumede says while the country functions as a democracy, citizens have lost confidence in government's ability to fulfil their promises. I think why people vote the way they vote is because they want change, they actually want the democracy to become more meaningful. He says the ANC government is at a crossroads and needs to create an inclusive democracy. You're not going to be President Jacob Zuma, because you are a president you have different sets of laws but you still argue that you are in a democracy. He says increased activism by the youth, non-traditional civil society groups and the introduction of technology are some of the main contributing factors to the changing political landscape (Edited by Neo Koza)
