State witness Luthando Siyoni has been declared hostile after refusing to answer questions from the prosecution over Jayde Panayiotou's murder. CAPE TOWN - The defence for Christopher Panayiotou claims the alleged middleman in Jayde Panayiotou s murder had informed the State he would not stick to his police statements when called to testify.State witness Luthando Siyoni has been declared a hostile witness after refusing to answer questions put to him by the prosecution to avoid being incriminated.The former bouncer has been testifying against his former boss Panayiotou and two others in the Port Elizabeth High Court.He has since deviated from his police statements in which he told authorities that Panayiotou was the mastermind behind his wife s death.Defence attorney Terry Price on Friday questioned Siyoni about his claims of receiving money that was meant for the alleged hitman. Price claims Panayiotou did not know alleged triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke who has since died. But Siyoni maintains the R80,000 he received from Panayiotou after his wife s killing was indeed meant for Vumazonke. The defence has also submitted email correspondence that took place between the State and the former bouncer s lawyer before the trial. In it, Siyoni apparently says he does not want to be a Section 204 witness for the State, which means he would lose immunity from prosecution and become a murder accused. Siyoni is adamant he had nothing to do with Jayde s murder in April last year. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
