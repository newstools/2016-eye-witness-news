CAPE TOWN - Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) says it is looking at ways to tackle false news websites, which is on the increase.Mail &amp; Guardian associate editor Philip de Wet says there has been a spike in the number of fake news websites which often masquerade as legitimate media groups.Often these websites try to pass off the false content as satire, hoping to get as many shares as possible on social media.But Eyewitness News editor-in-chief and deputy chair of the South African National Editor s Forum, Katy Katopodis says this trend could cause damage to the journalism industry. People no longer know who to believe and who to trust. And there are newsrooms with very hardworking journalists, whose job is to work very long hours to try and get stories that are indeed true and credible. I think it can be extremely damaging. The lobby group s director William Bird says there is no law stopping someone from creating a website where they can publish almost anything they want to.But Bird says the group is investigating ways to tackle this problem. One of the reasons they don t put legitimate sources into the news sites very often is because they know that if they were to quote you saying something you didn t say you could have a legal action against them. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg recently stated the site would implement stricter measures to protect users from false information as found on these sites.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
