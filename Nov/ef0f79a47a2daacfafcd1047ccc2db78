JOHANNESBURG The City of Tshwane says it will continue with water shedding in Mabopane, in northern Pretoria, as reservoirs are still under strain.The measure comes in the wake of the Department of Water and Sanitation s announcement that it will be cutting supply to all Gauteng municipalities.It says the drought continues as well as wasteful use by residents continues to negatively affect dam levels across the country.The metro says people should continue to use water sparingly across the capital.Department spokesperson Lindela Mashigo says, We ll continue implementing water shedding between 8pm and 5am on a daily basis until the water capacity increases to at least 60 percent. The use of water wisely should continue until the situation improves. Meanwhile, Joburg Water has said that if residents continue to flout water regulations, the city could soon move to stage 3 regulations.Johannesburg is currently under level two water restrictions, which means residents are not allowed to water their gardens between 6am and 6pm, fill pools with municipal water or wash cars using a hosepipe.Joburg Water s Tidimalo Chuene said: There are elements of rationing. It means you supply water to area A, while restricting water to area B. When you re satisfied you ll move to the next area. However, there are serious challenges in going that route. Water supply from the Vaal Dam is running low and several reservoirs, including the Lenasia high level and Alexander Park reservoirs, have also been affected.Chuene said technicians are working around the clock to stabilise the system. We are still struggling with the Lenasia reservoir and request residents to reduce consumption. Other areas that are affected are around Alexander Park and Meadowlands. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
