SA bounced back to form with a 2-1 win over Senegal in their 2018 World Cup Qualifier on Saturday. JOHANNESBURG Bafana Bafana have bounced back with a 2-1 win over Senegal in their 2018 World Cup Qualifier in Polokwane on Saturday.Shakes Mashaba s troop headed into the match exactly a year since they last won a competitive match at home following a draw against Burkina Faso. Both sides looked uncomfortable in the opening stages, with Bafana struggling to get their passing going in the midfield in particular.The first breakthrough came after a dubious call from the linesman gave South Africa a penalty which Thulani Hlatshwayo put away in the bottom corner despite the Senegalese goalkeeper getting a hand to the ball. Thulani Serero doubled Bafana s lead late on in the second half after he found the ball on the edge of the box and threaded a pinpoint ball through the defence and into the bottom corner.The second half saw South Africa attempting to close out the game, where they managed to find a lot more confidence and fluidity to their passing and movement. The dangerous Senegal eventually found the back of the net after a chaotic moment in the Bafana Bafana box. Ndoye was given the credit for the goal, despite Itumeleng Khune making two outstanding saves in the process.The result puts South Africa on four points from a possible six after two matches played in their Group D qualification stage.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
