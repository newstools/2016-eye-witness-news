The woman who accused the embattled ANC leader says she will continue with legal steps against him. CAPE TOWN - The woman who accused embattled African National Congress (ANC) provincial leader Marius Fransman of sexual assault says she will continue with legal steps against him.Fransman will reportedly be appealing the ANC s national disciplinary committee's (NDC) decision to suspend him for five years.The NDC has found Fransman guilty of abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the party into disrepute.Wynand's spokesperson Gavin Prins says there is still a matter of sexual assault against Fransman in the Northern Cape.Prins says Wynand is adamant to see the case through. This is obviously not the end of the road for her. This is one small step on her road to victory. Earlier this year, Wynand's original charges against Fransman were withdrawn in the North West due to a lack of evidence, but the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred in two provinces while on a road trip to the ANC's birthday celebrations in Rustenberg in January.Prins says while Wynand is relieved with the NDC's ruling, she still has a long way to go towards picking up the pieces of her life.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
