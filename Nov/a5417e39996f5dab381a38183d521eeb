Freedom Under Law &amp; the Helen Suzman Foundation are asking the court to force President Zuma to suspend Abrahams. JOHANNESBURG - Civic rights groups Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation says President Jacob Zuma acted irrationally by failing to suspend National Prosecution Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams.They are asking the court to force Zuma to suspend him.They also want Advocates Torie Pretorius and Sibongile Mzinyathi to be suspended over their handling of the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Lawyers representing the president and the NPA have argued that this urgent application is both baseless and premature.But Advocate David Unterhalter who is representing Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation says this is an urgent matter of public interest.He maintains that Abrahams needs to be stopped immediately to prevent further damage to the NPA.However, Abrahams legal team says the issue of urgency comes down to the fear that the Finance Minister might be charged again soon.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
