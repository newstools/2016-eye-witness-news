CAPE TOWN Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti says the results of a crackdown on land redistribution fraud should serve as a warning to other transgressors. Nkwinti officially received the title deeds of farms worth just over R300 million at Parliament yesterday.Investigators have identified at least 35 farms where they found irregularities during some stages of the redistribution process between 2011 and 2015.National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams says significant strides have been made in the investigations into land reform fraud. Approximately 12 cases have been referred for criminal investigations and prosecution. Nkwinti says they will punish those involved in land redistribution scams. We just have to be very blunt on this one: we will not tolerate anything that denies people the opportunity to improve the quality of their lives. The irregularities include over-pricing by sellers, collusion with department officials and intended beneficiaries being substituted with fictitious persons.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
