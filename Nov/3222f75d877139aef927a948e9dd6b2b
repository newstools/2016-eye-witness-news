South African paralympian Ernst van Dyk will be defending his win last year in the hand-cycle division. NEW YORK At least 50,000 people are expected to take to the streets of New York City today for the world's biggest marathon.South African paralympian Ernst van Dyk will be defending his win last year in the hand-cycle division.It s the 40th anniversary of the marathon s move to include all five burrows, a move van Dyk describes as extremely tough. Over the years I ve come to the conclusion that it s comparable to a 12-round fight. You get beat up so badly because of the climbing, the rough roads and bumpiness. It takes a special mindset. Van Dyk first won it in 1995 and last year, in a sweet victory, he scored by just one second.After winning gold at the Paralympics this year, he went on to do the Berlin and Chicago marathons before coming to New York. I m really tired. It s been a long year and the big goal this year was to win gold in Rio, I did that. He says no matter what happens today, he s happy to be back.People from over 100 countries are expected to compete in the New York City Marathon today.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
