Is there a significant sign of improvement in how municipalities are spending their money? The Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM), an agency centred on research, monitoring, advocacy and capacity building has worked consistently to provide municipalities with insight into some of the monitoring tools necessary to give effect to a citizen s right to hold their local government to account.Below, the PSAM shares its thoughts on the Auditor-General of South Africa's (AGSA's) report and says there is still a long way to go as some municipalities fail to provide sufficient evidence to support the legitimacy of their expenditure.What is the importance of the Auditor-General of South Africa's report in holding municipalities to account and does it reflect the overall performance of a municipality?The AG's report is vital because it examines the fair presentation and absence of material misstatements in financial statements; reliable and credible performance information for purposes of reporting on predetermined performance objectives, as well as compliance with all legislation governing financial matters.The audit report is further important since it identifies how municipalities can improve upon their performance, by for instance ensuring that qualified and competent staff are recruited and retained, that municipal staff must be accountable for non-performance, for not conforming to the key municipal legislation's.Moreover, the audit report reflects on the financial and performance management related weaknesses within municipalities, and it also determines whether there is compliance with key legislation or not.What are some of the loopholes if any in the standard compliance of municipalities? The AG's report on local government audit results for 2014-15, noted the following loopholes:Supply Chain Management (SCM) concerns: more municipalities than in 2011-12 have inadequate contract management. In the past four years, there is little visible improvement in addressing unfair (i.e. less competitive) procurement processes, and the high prevalence of awarding tenders to suppliers that are linked to councillors and government officials.Moreover, there is little progress made in complying with the Municipal Financial Management Act (MFMA) during the awarding of tenders to suppliers.Since 2010-11 irregular expenditure has increased to R14.75 billion. An increasing number of municipalities are still not complying with SCM legislation, resulting in the continued incurrence of irregular expenditure.In 2014-15, fruitless and wasteful expenditure was R1.34 billion making it higher than in 2010-11. The main contributors were an increasing number of municipalities in the provinces of Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, North West, Free State and Northern Cape.Unauthorised expenditure also increased threefold from 2010-11 to R15.32 billion, and it is caused by overspending of the budget. However, the AG noted that more than 60% of overspending is related to non-cash items, i.e. estimates of depreciation or impairments that were not correctly budgeted for.In 2014-15 the AG rated the financial health of 92% of the municipalities as either concerning or requiring intervention. The AG stated that the most concerning indicators over the past three years were municipalities spending more than the resources they had available (thus incurring a net deficit); current liabilities exceeding current assets at year-end (net current liability position); debtors (ratepayers and consumers of water and electricity) not paying or taking very long to pay their debt; and creditors not being paid on time.By the end of 2014-15, over a quarter of municipalities were in a poor financial position with material uncertainty regarding their ability to continue operating in the foreseeable future.Is there a significant sign of improvement in how municipalities are spending their money?The 2014-15 General Report on local government shows that municipalities have improvements in their audit results from 2010-11 to 2014-15. The number of municipalities that received clean audits has increased from 13 to 54. Eighteen additional municipal entities also achieved clean audit status, taking the total number of clean audits to 72.While there are improvements, there is a long way to go towards achieving a significant improvement across the 272 South African municipalities.What can those municipalities who have received a qualified audit do to improve their financial statements?Municipalities need to better comply with key legislation (i.e. the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA), the Municipal Structures Act, the Municipal Systems Act).For instance, there are still high levels of non-compliance with key legislation even though improvements are noted.Additionally, municipalities must improve by submitting financial statements accompanied by sufficient evidence to support the legitimacy of their expenditure.Moreover, staff training should be considered to ensure that all operational staff not only comply with but understand the requirements of key legislation, and the standards for holding municipalities accountable. In addition, there is a need to improve internal accountability systems for non-performing municipal officials.Visit EWN's special municipal spending portal - created in partnership with the Auditor-General - to see how your taxes are being spent at local government level.
