Bheki Ntshalintshali says Cosatu has no confidence in Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called on Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to step down, describing him as a weak and polarizing figure. The labour federation held a briefing earlier on Thursday following its central executive committee meeting, where it also confirmed it will be supporting Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over as African National Congress (ANC) leader. Cosatu's General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says the federation has no confidence in Zwane. &quot;He is a weak and polarizing figure that has failed to deal with the biggest issue like retrenchments, illegal mining and ongoing violence.&quot; On Wednesday, while addressing the national assembly, President Jacob Zuma touched on the issue of Zwane, who recently incorrectly stated that an investigation would be held into the conduct of the banks after they closed their accounts with the Gupta family. The president told MPs the minister has apologised and the matter is now closed.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
