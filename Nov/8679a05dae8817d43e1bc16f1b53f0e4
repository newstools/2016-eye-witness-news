CAPE TOWN - Firefighters have managed to contain a fire on the mountain slopes above Simon's Town.Fire crews responded to the blaze shortly after 7am on Friday.A helicopter was brought in and helped to contain the flames, which were being fueled by strong wind.The City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Theo Layne says crews will remain on the scene throughout the day. The fire is being flamed by a very strong southeasterly wind, which makes firefighting very difficult because we can t get our conventional vehicles up the mountain to put water on it.
