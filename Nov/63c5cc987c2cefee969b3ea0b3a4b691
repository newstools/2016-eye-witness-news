The president will be accompanied by the rest of the ANC&#8217;s top six. JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma is expected to meet with African National Congress (ANC) veterans, who have called for him to step down, today.The president will be accompanied by the rest of the ANC s top six. The ruling party s National Working Committee will this morning prepare how to approach the meeting and later meet with the stalwarts who have raised leadership concerns.The veterans have also expressed concern over the ANC s loss of support at this year s polls and recent developments at the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and the National Treasury. Meanwhile, political analysts say Zuma s comments at the ANC cadres forum are an indication that he s pushing back at what has been described as a regime change agenda.At the weekend, the president took a swipe at his critics, political parties and civil society group Save SA, questioning their motives and claiming to have information that he would one day reveal.Zuma says there are people who are a part of a funded campaign against the ANC and are being used by white monopoly capital to destroy the ruling party because it remains a threat.Analyst Somadoda Fikeni says President Zuma has now entered survival mode. There s no doubt that the president feels vulnerable and he feels he s been attacked from within the organisation itself. But Professor Sipho Seepe disagrees. If you were to see more than three of four provinces taking him on, then I d say he s now reached a stage of surviving. But what you see there is a person who s saying now it s time to fight back. Opposition parties have lambasted Zuma for saying he knows the real thieves stealing from the state, saying he must come clean as a part of his legal obligation as president.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
