Vusimusi Mncube compiled a report alleging tender irregularities at Airports Company South Africa PRETORIA Eyewitness News has learnt the author of a forensic report alleging tender irregularities at Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) is himself accused of fraud and embezzlement and is fighting extradition to Burundi to stand trial. Vusimusi Mncube compiled the report for Acsa, which has led to recommendations that its chief executive Bongani Maseko and other senior managers be suspended. Mncube and two co-accused allegedly embezzled $600,000 from Burundi s state communications company Onatel in 2004.In 2006, a South African magistrates court ruled there were sufficient grounds to extradite the three to face trial in Burundi but it s understood appeal proceedings have stalled the process. In that same year, former President Thabo Mbeki also consented to the trio being surrendered for prosecution.Mncube declined to discuss the details of the $600,000 fraud case in Burundi he is fighting, adding that the matter is still before the courts. The person who would know the details of it is the guy who was a chairman at the time, who, in fact when there were issues with this deal - which is not what the board delegated him to go do in Burundi - absconded from the company. He says the magistrate s extradition ruling as well as Mbeki s decision is being appealed. The High Court postponed it and said the NPA was supposed to set it down and they ve never set it down until today. It s understood that in 2012, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) found that a local prosecution was possible.The NPA says it is looking into the current status of this case.
