On Wednesday, 53-year-old Thomas Mair was convicted of murdering Cox, and handed a life sentence. LONDON The family of slain British politician Jo Cox says her ideals will live on and her killer s attempts to silence her have failed. On Wednesday, 53-year-old Thomas Mair was convicted of murdering Cox, and handed a life sentence. The murder has been described as an act of terrorism, committed shortly before the Brexit referendum by a right-wing extremist. Cox s husband Brendan says Mair deserves nothing but pity. As a family, we ll not respond to hatred with hatred, we ll love like Jo did. And know that although she s dead, the ideas and values that she held so deeply will live on. Cox s sister Kim says the family will not be beaten. There may have been one act of extreme cowardice that day but there were many acts of bravery. Mair did not testify during his trial and it took the jury an hour and a half to convict the man who apparently shouted 'Britain first' as he shot and stabbed the mother of two. Judge Alan Wilkie denied a request by Mair to speak after the verdict and told him, You are no patriot. By your actions you have betrayed the quintessence of our country and its adherence to parliamentary democracy. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
