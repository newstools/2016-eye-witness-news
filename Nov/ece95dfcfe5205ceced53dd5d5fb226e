GERMANY German pilots union VC said on Sunday it was open to further talks with Lufthansa to try to find a compromise over a long-running pay dispute that caused a four-day strike last week, adding the airline needed to present a new offer. It will become clear in the course of the day how the dispute will continue, a spokesman for VC told Reuters.Lufthansa said earlier that all flights would start on schedule on Monday, 28 November, as there had been no further strike call from VC so far.Lufthansa cancelled nearly 2,800 flights during a four-day strike from Wednesday that affected more than 350,000 passengers, the 14th walkout in a dispute since early 2014 that has cost the carrier hundreds of millions of euros.Germany's biggest airline earlier urged VC to resume talks. We have to talk, Bettina Volkens, Lufthansa's board member in charge of human resources, told Bild am Sonntag. I hope very much that (VC) finally changes its uncompromising stance. This cannot be forced via strikes.
