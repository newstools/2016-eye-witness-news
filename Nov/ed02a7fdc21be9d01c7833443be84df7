A heart-pounding video of a lizard coming up against a pit of snakes has been doing the rounds on social media. JOHANNESBURG You ve seen serpent-studded movies like Snakes on a Plane, Anaconda, Python, Snake Island right?You ve seen how the slithering creatures can strike as fast as lightning and devour their prey in a matter of minutes.A heart-pounding video of a lizard coming up against a pit of snakes has been doing the rounds on social media.In the BBC's Planet Earth II documentary series footage, the lizard is chased by a snake and then runs and falls onto desert sand and rocks.Suddenly about half a dozen snakes appear, peeping their heads out, the way a meerkat would do when on the lookout for predators.Like a scene from a western movie, the lizard versus the gang of snakes lock eyes, a snake comes from behind, the lizard runs and all hell breaks loose!Possibly the greatest scene in documentary history. Incredible. #PlanetEarth2 pic.twitter.com/01dDjDJcdX
