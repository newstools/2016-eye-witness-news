The band joined a crowd protesting against the spray painting of swastikas at a New York park named after a former band member. JOHANNESBURG - The Beastie Boys have taken a stand against the spray painting of swastikas at a New York park named in memory of band member Adam Yauch. The band joined fans, faith leaders and politicians at an anti-hate rally in the city to condemn the pro-Trump graffiti, with crowds chanting "love trumps hate". Speaking at the weekend rally, the band members said that spray-painting swastikas at a children's playground is a ‘messed up thing to do’. The graffiti has now been removed and the space re-decorated by local children who used cut-out hearts, chalk drawings and flowers.
