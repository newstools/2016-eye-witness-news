The president made his first public appeared in SA yesterday since the release of the 'State of Capture' report. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma's speech at a rally in KwaZulu-Natal has been seen as a blanket attack on those who have levelled allegations against him.Speaking for the first time after the release of the State of Capture report, during a victory rally in eDumbe in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday, Zuma hit back at those calling for him to step down.Last week, the state capture report revealed that Zuma failed to act on a number of damning allegations. The president says he's not afraid of prison, as he spent 10 years behind bars.The president appears to have also taken a swipe at African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwarts and former president Thabo Mbeki for criticising the party's leadership from outside its structures.Zuma says the space for democratic debate in the country has now been taken over by the courts, similar to the apartheid government. That s misrepresentation of democracy. We must debate issues, debate them.&quot;Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni has described Zuma's take on the use of the judiciary as a blanket attack to settle scores. It s a blanket attack on the judiciary or the use of the judiciary. Zuma has accused opposition parties of using South Africa's courts as a platform to fight political battles.But Fikeni says the ANC may be missing a grand opportunity to correct itself, which may come at a high price. It may mean that the ANC risks going to the next conference as a divided party. They may even losing the upcoming 2019 elections. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
