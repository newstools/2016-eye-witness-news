The NPA head must explain to President Jacob Zuma why he should not be suspended as National Director of Public Prosecutions. JOHANNESBURG - Today is the deadline for Shaun Abrahams to explain to President Jacob Zuma why he should not be suspended as National Director of Public Prosecutions.Earlier this month, the president asked Abrahams to motivate why he should not be suspended over his handling of the fraud case against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials.Last week, a court application by lobby groups Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation to have the NPA head and two senior colleagues suspended immediately pending an inquiry, was dismissed in the North Gauteng High Court.Abrahams and two of his colleagues, Torie Pretorius and Sibongile Mzinyathi, have until close of business to make submissions on why Zuma should not suspended them.Earlier this month, Eyewitness News revealed a series of letters between Abrahams and Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza in which Ntlemeza said the decision to drop charges against Gordhan was not made in good faith.The finance minister was initially charged for granting early retirement to two former Sars employees.
