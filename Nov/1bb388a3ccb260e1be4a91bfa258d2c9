Chris Yelland and Outa have teamed up after requesting the information from the power utility and receiving no response. JOHANNESBURG - The managing director of EE Publishers Chris Yelland and civil society group Outa are taking Eskom to court to force the parastatal to disclose information about week-on-week energy availability in the country.Yelland has teamed up with Outa after requesting the information from the power utility and receiving no response.He says this type of information was always available on Eskom s website up until April. We have submitted a Promotion of Access to Information (PAIA) application for Eskom to provide this data. Eskom has not responded in any way and after 90 days without a response, this is deemed to be a refusal of access to information. So we have now submitted court documents seeking a court order to force Eskom to provide this information. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
