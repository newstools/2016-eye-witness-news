Hawks spokesperson Hangwane Mulaudzi says the investigations into the Sars rogue unit are ongoing. JOHANNESBURG The Hawks have asked the public to give them space as they continue with investigations into fresh charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.The City Press is reporting that there are renewed efforts to try and speed up a probe into the so called Sars rouge unit and have Gordhan charged by next month.On Monday, National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams announced that he will not prosecute the finance minister, Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay on fraud charges in connection with the early retirement package.The paper goes on to say both the Hawks and the prosecuting authority's investigators want to make sure they have a strong case against Gordhan to be charged before Christmas.Hawks spokesperson Hangwane Mulaudzi says the investigations into the rogue unit are however ongoing. This matter has been in the public arena for some time and has been ongoing with the help of the NPA. Mulaudzi says the hawks are doing their job to investigate to have the matter cleared but there is no time frame as to when and if the minister will be charged. We need to be given space to do our job correctly because there seems to be too much pressure from people outside o go and make unfounded claims about the investigations.
