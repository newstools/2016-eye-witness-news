Freedom Under Law says the charges the NPA brought against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were utterly baseless. JOHANNESBURG - Civil society organisation Freedom Under Law has accused National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams in court papers of &quot;a display of incompetence of a magnitude so stupefying that it beggars belief&quot;.FUL filed papers on an urgent basis to try and get the courts to force the president to suspend Abrahams along with prosecutors Sibongile Mzinyathi and Torie Pretorius. The organisation said the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were utterly baseless. Freedom Under Law said it believed Abrahams was either incompetent and not fit to hold office or he was not acting independently and was beholden to others. It argued in the court papers that there had been an abuse of public power for &quot;such blatantly obvious ulterior motives&quot; that it had caused a national uproar and riots in the streets.It also said that immense public power was exercised in a manner so recklessly that it sent the economy into a nose dive and wiped R50 billion off the JSE. The organisation believes the prosecutors should have recognised the enormity of their failures and resigned of their own accord and said it was &quot;astounding that there was not a trace of humility or accountability&quot;. Abrahams, the NPA and the presidency are yet to respond.MUST WATCH: Shaun Abrahams on political capture, charging a president and more
