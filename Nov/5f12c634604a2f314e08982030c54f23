CAPE TOWN The Proteas are gearing up for the first day of the three-match Test series against Australia.The first Test match begins on Thursday at the usually seamer friendly WACA in Perth.South Africa have already played two warm-up matches in which some the batsmen have cashed in with some big knocks.The uncapped Keshav Maharaj will battle it out with fellow spinner Tabraiz Shamsi for the spinning berth in the team, however Maharaj is unsure of the selectors' plan regarding the makeup of the team. That s going to be left to the selection panel, I don t really know. I have just been trying to my business, hopefully it s enough to crack the nod. Obviously I am very anxious, I want to play my first Test, having said that it comesdown to the best possible team to win the match on the day. Hopefully I can crack the nod and be in the starting 11. Star batsmen Hashim Amla says the Proteas excellent record at the WACA will count for nothing going into the first Test. As a team we have two good successes that we have played, but coming to this Test series, we can draw some experience from that, but it s a clean slate for both teams and that s how we treat it. Middle order batter Temba Bavuma says the team has put in a lot of graft ahead of the important Test series. Preparation s gone quite good, we have been knuckling down on our game plan and tactics. We are looking forward to the Test. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
