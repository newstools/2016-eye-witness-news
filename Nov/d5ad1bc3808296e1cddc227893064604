ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu has spoken out against delays in scheduling parties&#8217; motions for debate. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu has appealed to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete not to delay decisions on when parties requests for motions should be debated.Mthembu was speaking during a National Assembly programming committee meeting on Thursday morning.The Democratic Alliance s (DA) motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma is set to take place this afternoon.The opposition party on Sunday threatened legal action after complaining that Mbete was not treating it with the necessary urgency. When a request is made to your office by the parties please decide quickly so that all of us are then able to schedule a date for such a matter in the House. Because when we don't decide as quickly as we should, it then creates unintended consequences.&quot;The DA tabled its motion of no confidence more than 20 days ago. It considered going to court to force a decision on the date it would be debated.National Assembly rules say a motion of no confidence must be given &quot;due priority&quot; after consultation with the leader of government business and the majority party s chief whip.The debate was this week set down for this afternoon, a date initially proposed by the DA.A DA call for a debate on the National Prosecuting Authority has been scheduled for next month, but the party wants this brought forward.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
