This will happen for the for the next 19 days in order to protect the 25% minimum level for the Vaal Dam. JOHANNESBURG The Water and Sanitation Department says it will continue to draw water from the Sterkfontein Dam for the next 19 days in order to protect the 25% minimum level for the Vaal Dam.The department started releasing water at the beginning of the month and says it has just about reached the Vaal Dam.The Vaal river system consists of 14 dams, mainly servicing Gauteng, with at least 13 million users. The department says the Sterkfontein Dam has decreased by 1.3% to 90% due to the planned release to the Vaal Dam.It also says the Vaal Dam has increased by 1.9% week on week, to 33.4% due to the rainfall.The department s Mlimandela Ndamase says they will assess after the next 19 days, whether water from the Sterkfontein Dam still needs to be released to assist with the Vaal. We ll continue with that release for the next 19 days. However, we ll continue to monitor the system. We ll continue to ensure that the release is still necessary and should we get more rainfall that gives us some surety, we ll start considering maybe pulling back a bit or reducing the release. Meanwhile, the South African Weather Service has issued a warning for severe thunderstorms in the Gauteng province later today and a 60% chance of rain every day this week until Saturday.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
