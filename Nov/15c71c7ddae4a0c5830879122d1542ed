WATCH: Save SA plans to hold public servants accountableGROUPS TO PUT PRESSURE ON ZUMACivic organisations say they will continue to put pressure on the President to step down.Around 200 people, including Former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor and former Hawks boss Anwa Dramat, were among demonstrators against state capture in Cape Town yesterday.The group insisted that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams and President Jacob Zuma must resign for undermining their oaths.Vytjie Mentor says the National Prosecuting Authority has been compromised due to political interference.She says under Shaun Abrahams leadership, the NPA has been jeopardised. Shaun Abrahams must go. If he doesn t want to go, he must be pushed. If the minister doesn t push him, he (the minister) must be pushed out. If Parliament doesn t push the minister to push him out, Parliament must be pushed out. It s simple as that. We can t have a compromised National Prosecuting Authority. Mentor says President Jacob Zuma s dubious relationship with the Gupta family has resulted in a hostile political climate.She says to save the ANC and the economy Zuma must do the honourable thing and step down.Read the Public Protector's full 'State of Capture' report below: State Capture Report 2016 by Primedia Broadcasting on ScribdMADONSELA REPORT REVEALS GUPTA FAMILY ROLEAdvocate Thuli Madonsela s explosive State of capture report has revealed how the Gupta family played a key role in Cabinet appointments, made under-handed deals to pursue business interests and how the president failed to take action.In an unexpected turn of events yesterday, President Zuma s legal team withdrew his application to interdict the release of the report, the High Court in Pretoria then ordered the Public Protector to publish the document before the end of the business day.Cell phone records show how several people are linked to the Guptas, including Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, and how Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen was at the Gupta compound the night before his brief appointment as Finance Minister last year.Madonsela has called on Zuma to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry within 30 days to investigate all the issues she s identified, using her record of the investigation and the report as a starting point.The former Public Protector relied on cell phone records to corroborate evidence and it places several people at the Gupta residence in Saxonwold where secret meetings took place.This is also where deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas claims he was offered the job of Finance Minister by Ajay Gupta when he made this claim in a public statement earlier this year.HOW OFFICIALS DEALT WITH GUPTASNow looking at this from a numerical point of view: R600 million. That s the amount of money the Gupta family allegedly offered Jonas and they even told him he could have it immediately, provided he had a bag large enough to carry the cash.On 8 December 2015: that s the day Zuma fired Nhanhla Nene as Finance minister and told him he would be deployed to the Brics bank. That deployment has still not materialized, almost 11 months later.It s a noteworthy date, as phone records also place Van Rooynen at the Gupta s Saxonwold home on the 8th.He spent much of that first week visiting the family.Forty-four: that s the number of times Molefe called Ajay Gupta between August 2015 and March 2016. It works out to an average of a phone call every five days over a 233-day stretch.Those same records place Molefe in Saxonwold 19 times between August and November last year, which works out to one visit every five days over a period of 93 days.Two-hundred and sixteen: that s the number of pages in the report that deals with the skulduggery around Eskom and the coal firms - that s about 60% of the entire report.And last but not least: on 6 October 2016, that s the day Madonsela met with Zuma to get his version of events.Zuma did not answer any questions.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
