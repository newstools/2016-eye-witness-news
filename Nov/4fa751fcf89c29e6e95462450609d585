The loss was sustained during the 2014/15 financial year, the biggest ever sustained by a state-owned enterprise in SA. CAPE TOWN - A forensic report on the R14.5 billion loss incurred by state-owned gas-to-fuel company PetroSA will now be discussed by Parliament s energy committee behind closed doors.This is the decision announced by committee chairperson Fikile Majola earlier today.PetroSA board members and Department of Energy officials were last week sent packing by the committee after they tried to present an executive summary of the forensic report.The committee insisted the full PetroSA board return to Parliament today with the complete report.The R14.5 billion loss was sustained during the 2014/15 financial year - the biggest ever sustained by a state-owned entity in South Africa. It was due largely to Project Ikhwezi a costly failed attempt to dig offshore wells for more gas.Majola says according to a legal opinion, PetroSA was advised it would not be in its interests to make the information available to third parties. Having regard to the constitution and our law, I m quite clear in my mind as a general principle that Parliament must have access to all information that is in state organs - but that Parliament would (also) have the responsibility to safeguard these entities. The Democratic Alliance s Pieter van Dalen wasn t happy with the development. This is a public entity, that works with public money, that has to answer to the public. Van Dalen suggested the committee first look at the information and decide the commercially sensitive aspects be redacted.A date for the meeting is yet to be set.
