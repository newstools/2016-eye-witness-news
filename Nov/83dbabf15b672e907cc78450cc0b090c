UCT&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Institute says R360 is not relevant for children&#8217;s needs and puts care givers under pressure on what to buy. JOHANNESBURG - The University of Cape Town s Children s Institute says the percentage of child poverty has reduced significantly since the introduction of the child grant system - but that amount remains very low.The organisation s Aislinn Delany says R360 is not relevant for children s needs and puts care givers under pressure on what to buy.Delany says the children s grant is equal to just a loaf of bread a day. The value of the grant of around R360 a month is equivalent to about R12 a day. She says it creates a situation where caregivers have to make hard choices. It does mean care givers have to make hard choices; what will they use that money for? Buying food and can they still afford to buy school shoes? She says among the short comings of the grant is that only one in six eligible children receive the grant. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
