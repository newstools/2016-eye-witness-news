JOHANNESBURG - Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago says while the outlook for the country s economic growth remains subdued, the low point has now passed and the economy is set to grow. Kganyago announced that the repo rate will remain unchanged at 7%, saying that despite higher inflation, the outlook has improved. There were concerns that rising inflation of 6.4% for October would lead to an increase in the repo rate.Kganyago said that the bank's forecast for the year stands at 0.4% but an improvement is expected next year. However, he says the third quarter may be subdued. Growth in the third quarter is likely to be positive but well below the rate recorded in the second quarter. Kgayago said that the rand has managed to stand its ground despite a number of pressured situations and this has helped keep inflation down. The higher food price assumption is offset by a slightly more appreciated exchange rate assumption. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
