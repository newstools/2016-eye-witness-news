Metalworkers union Numsa says the proposed national minimum wage of R3,500 doesn't come close to the amount workers deserve. JOHANNESBURG - Metalworkers union Numsa says the proposed national minimum wage of R3,500 is still what it considers a &quot;poverty wage&quot; that doesn't come close to the amount workers deserve.On Sunday, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that a panel of advisors had proposed the figure as a starting level which would be reviewed annually once the legislation has been passed.The African National Congress said it would introduce a minimum wage while campaigning in the 2014 national elections.Numsa's Patrick Craven says the proposed amount is disappointing. Particularly in the light of the huge inequalities within South Africa, it must be a national living wage and it must be integrated with a policy on comprehensive social security and national health insurance scheme. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have rejected a proposed national minimum wage, describing it as an absolute disregard for the interests of workers.LISTEN: EFF rejects proposal for minimum wage(Edited by Neo Koza)
