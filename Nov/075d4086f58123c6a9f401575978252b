The union has called on 'Comrade Jacob Zuma' to take the 'honourable and courageous decision' in the interests of the ANC. JOHANNESBURG - The National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) says President Jacob Zuma should leave office before his current term as president ends in 2019.#Nehawu BREAKING Nehawu &quot;Calls on Comrade Jacob Zuma to take honourable &amp; courageous decision&quot; in the interests of the ANC. SG#Nehawu Nehawu: We call on ANC NEC to invoke precedent whereby Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa succeeds Zuma. SGIt s become the first member of the tripartite alliance to call for Zuma to go.Earlier today the Nelson Mandela Foundation also said the ANC should remove Zuma from office as there was increasingly a national consensus that he had failed the test of being a constitutional being.Nehawu s first deputy president Mike Shingange says they've decided President Zuma should step down. It doesn t matter anymore whether the allegations against him and the difficulties the country is going through is only his fault [sic]. But we think that the perception is such that he should do the honourable thing and make sure that he leaves that position. Nehawu also says the ANC should take a unifying decision that deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa should take over as president.This call is likely to lead to heated opposition from Zuma supporters, but other formations may come out publicly and say they agree with Nehawu.
