The department says over 50,000 parents of pupils in grade 1 and 8 have been offered spaces for the 2017 academic year. JOHANNESBURG – The Gauteng Education Department has made a special appeal to parents to confirm offers of placement at various schools across the province by the end of today. The department says over 50,000 parents of pupils in grades 1 and 8 have been offered spaces for the 2017 academic year but have not yet finalised the school of their choice. It says that those who fail to confirm will risk losing their offers. The department's spokesperson Oupa Bodibe says: “We appeal for them to either accept or reject offers of placement because that will help then place other parents who are on the queue and we have given them until today to do so.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
