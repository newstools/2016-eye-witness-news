Asked whether it would still go ahead, newly elected chairperson Smith had this to say: As things stand now, unless and until everybody that is on that board indicates that they are stepping down, we are duty bound to continue with the process, as expensive as it is, it will be unfortunate but it is something that we will have to do in the interests of justice. Smith says the committee has a budget of R400,000 for the inquiry. Hearings are set to begin on 29 November. Among those expected to testify include Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and journalists, some of who are being intimidated and harassed, which the committee has strongly condemned.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
