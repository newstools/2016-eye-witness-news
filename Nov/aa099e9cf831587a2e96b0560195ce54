The aggrieved title deed holders believe their homes were sold for between R6,000 and R8,000. CAPE TOWN More than a dozen Hout Bay families say they have been left out in the cold after low-cost houses meant for them were given to other families.Residents say despite qualifying for subsidised government homes in Imizamo Yethu, they have been unable to move in because the units have been fraudulently reallocated.The aggrieved title deed holders believe their homes were sold for between R6,000 and R8,000.The list of those entitled to receive houses was compiled by the community-elected People's Housing Process Committee and City of Cape Town officials.It was ratified by the municipality in 2008.Longtime resident Manelisi Nondala says he owns the title deed to a plot, but the house built there was allocated to someone else. Community members from Masakhane told me we re two people on the same number, so we can t give two people the same number. In a written reply to Eyewitness News, the City of Cape Town says it s aware of the issues surrounding the low-cost housing development in Imizamo Yethu.Human Settlements Mayoral Committee member, Benedicta van Minnen says In most cases the approved subsidy was correctly used to build a house but the title deeds were transferred incorrectly .She adds, a newly appointed conveyancer is expected start with the first series of rectifications before the end of the year.UTILITY BILLS PILE UPPriscilla Moloke says she s received the utility bills for plot 9226 despite not living in the house there. At the moment I don t have a house but what I only got is the water bills and the title deed. My water bill is standing now R6,499, that comes to me, Priscilla Moloke where I stay. The Molokes are among fifteen families initially named on the City s approved housing beneficiaries list. The bills are apparently being sent to the families' old addresses which are mainly informal shacks. The City says to rectify the housing blunder, deed holders may have to de-register their plots to enable the transfer of the properties to the correct owners. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
