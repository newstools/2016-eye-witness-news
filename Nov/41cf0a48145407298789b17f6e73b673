The Division of Revenue Amendment Bill provides for money raised through taxes to be allocated to government. JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of disrespecting its voters by not taking its work in Parliament seriously enough.EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu laid the charge after the National Assembly was unable to approve a crucial budget bill on Tuesday afternoon because there was no quorum.The Division of Revenue Amendment Bill provides for money raised nationally through taxes and levies to be allocated to provincial and local government.There were 233 Member of Parliament (MPs) in the House at the start of the debate but when it came to voting, there were only 197 not enough for the bill to pass.Shivambu compared the ANC benches to last week s massive turnout when a motion of no confidence in the president was defeated. You have been a majority by the people of South Africa and you handle it with such levels of irresponsibility how do you not come to pass a Division of Revenue Bill? You are not governing seriously, the people must reject you, okay? And when the Guptas were being defended here, you came in numbers. It s unclear why there was no quorum, as ANC MPs were under a three-line whip to attend today s sitting. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu s told MPs none of three EFF MPs present voted at all and that an ANC MP's vote was not recorded by the system.The Division of Revenue Amendment Bill will now have to be brought back to the National Assembly for the process to be repeated.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
