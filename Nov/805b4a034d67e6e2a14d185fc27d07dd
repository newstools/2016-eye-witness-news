The league has responded to a recent case at Wits University&#8217;s Junction residence where a woman was apparently attacked. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) has condemned what it says is the continued rape culture at institutions of higher learning. The league has responded to a recent case at Wits University s Junction residence where a woman was apparently attacked. Earlier this week students accused the university of dragging its feet when investigating the incident. The ANCWL says increasing cases of sexual violence reported on South African campuses are a cause for concern. The league has called on Wits University and other institutions to see to it that these crimes are thoroughly investigated with the help of law enforcement agencies. While an investigation continues into the incident at Wits, the Junction House committee has called for vice-chancellor Adam Habib to step down in his position as an ambassador of the He for She campaign. Committee chairperson Nkululeko Tselane says; He himself is protecting rape culture at Wits, and it s contradictory that he has placed an extra burden on himself and has failed in that extra burden. The house committee says it will continue to engage management until a commitment is made to review the institution's policies on sexual assault and rape. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
