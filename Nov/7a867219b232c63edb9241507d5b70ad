The stalwarts have requested a meeting with President Jacob Zuma on the crisis they say the movement is facing. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts reacted to former public protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report on Thursday, saying the evidence contained in the report shows that President Jacob Zuma brought shame to both the organisation and the country. The stalwarts held a briefing in Park Town earlier, where they confirmed they had written a letter to the President requesting a meeting.Former ANC deputy Secretary General Cheryl Carolus said President Zuma was at the centre of the blatant looting of public assets facilitated by state capture. Sadly, at the centre of this disgraceful behavior sits our president and some dodgy people with whom he has surrounded himself. Our president has brought shame to our organization and to our country. Among the veterans was Murphy Morobe, who said they had seen many things but the state capture revelations were probably the hardest to deal with. This has been one of those that has been very hard for them to tackle and deal with.&quot; The veterans said they wanted to meet the President to discuss the crisis which they believed the movement was facing, and which was affecting the country.
