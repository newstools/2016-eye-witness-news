An eighth suspect is still at large.The organisation s Ngaa Murombedzi says communities must help in keeping children safe. To make sure that they don t wander in places that are dangerous, they don t wander into deserted places. But also for schools and for community outreach programmes to teach these children safety measures so that they don t find themselves falling victim constantly to predators.

We re trying to move the children from focusing on blaming themselves and focusing on the incident.
