Human rights groups been a new intensification of repression and crimes against opponents of President Nkurunziza. JOHANNESBURG Human rights groups are calling on Africa, Europe and the United Nations (UN) to send a military force to prevent a civil war and possible genocide in Burundi.They say there s been a new intensification of repression and crimes against opponents of President Pierre Nkurunziza.The International Federation For Human Rights and the Burundian Human Rights League have issued a 200-page report listing what they call dramatic actions by the Burundian government.These include the expulsion of African Union and United Nations human rights experts from Burundi, the denunciation by the Burundian government of a UN human rights report critical of actions in Bujumbura, Burundi s withdrawal from the International Criminal Court and the suspension of five human rights organisations in Burundi.The alarm bells started ringing, say the watchdogs, when President Nkurunziza decided to take an unconstitutional third term at the helm.(Edited By Masechaba Sefularo)
