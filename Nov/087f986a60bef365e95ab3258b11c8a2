The JHB mayor claimed the man was taken to the Steve Biko Hospital &amp; died after waiting several hours to be attended to. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has criticised Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba for claiming a man, who was allegedly killed by a member of the presidential protection unit, was taken to the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria where he died after waiting several hours without receiving medical attention.Mahlangu refuted claims that Solly Mootlana, 59, was taken to the said hospital, but says that instead he was taken to the Tshwane District Hospital.Mootlana was knocked over and killed on Friday.The man who allegedly knocked him over is now being investigated for culpable homicide.Mahlangu says the 59-year-old man received medical attention at the Tshwane District Hospital.She adds Mashaba and media reports were factually incorrect.However, Mashaba remains adamant the man died while awaiting medical treatment at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital and has challenged Mahlangu to refute this under oath. I request that the MEC and I make our statement under oath because it looks like one of us is lying to the nation. Mr Mashaba shouldn t use politics to play with people s lives and so now we ll just leave the matter there. Mahlangu has sent condolences to the Mootlana family. We wish them strength and God s prayers during this difficult time. News about Mootlana came to light after Mashaba tweeted about the accident and said the man was knocked over by President Jacob Zuma's motorcade, a statement which the Presidency has denied.I have just received the terrible news that President Zuma&#39;s blue lights brigades killed a friend Solly Moutlana in Pretoria yesterdayI was under impression that these blue lights convoys were banned in Pretoria,unless under extreme circumstances(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
