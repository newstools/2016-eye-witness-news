Britain&#8217;s economy is now expected to grow by 1.4% next year and could be &#163;120 billion worse off thanks to Brexit. JOHANENSBURG The British government is facing fresh accusations of not having a solid economic plan to exit the European Union (EU). This follows the autumn budget speech which was delivered on Wednesday by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. Hammond revealed a dramatic revision of the country s economic growth forecast for next year.He says the government s plan is designed to prepare the economy for the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. It sends a clear message to the world that Britain is open for business and it provides help to those who need it now. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell says six years have already been wasted and Britain remains unprepared and unequipped. This is a new conservative leadership, with no answers to the challenges facing our country and no vision to secure our future prosperity. Britain s economy is now expected to grow by 1.4% next year and could be 120 billion worse off thanks to Brexit. TOURISM BETWEEN SA &amp; UK GROWINGMeanwhile, the British High Commissioner to South Africa says tourism between the United Kingdom and South Africa is on a significant increase.High Commissioner Judith MacGregor says air-travel specifically is seeing more routes open between the two countries even with the uncertainty brought about by Brexit.The High Commissioner was speaking at the National Press Club s UK and South Africa relations post Brexit discussion in Pretoria.MacGregor says the United Kingdom is registering an unusual boom in South Africans applying for tourism visas recently.Macgregor says the currencies between the two countries have somewhat leveled to make travel to and from the two countries more economical. I think the tourism picture is good coming out of South Africa and to my particular delight, we seem to have been seeing an unusual boom in the number of visa applications at this time of the year. She says beyond tourism, the UK, aims to maintain and grow trade relations with South Africa.SLOWER GROWTH, MORE DEBTThe budget forecasters said gross domestic product would grow 1.4% in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018, down from March s pre-referendum estimates of 2.2 and 2.1%.The Office for Budget Responsibility also said Brexit would lower trade flows, business investment and migration, cutting Britain s growth potential, although it said it remained in the dark about what kind of Brexit deal the government might seek.Brexit supporters questioned the credibility of the latest OBR report, especially the forecasts for 2017.Hammond set himself an easier target for the budget deficit, saying he was targeting a shortfall of less than 2% of GDP by 2020, excluding cyclical swings in the economy.Previously, the government had targeted a surplus in the overall budget by the end of the decade, an increasingly tough challenge that prompted former Chancellor Osborne to announce an unpopular squeeze on spending.Hammond reserved himself some fiscal headroom to spend more if the economy takes a turn for the worse. But his overall message was not radically different from Osborne s as he promised to get rid of the overall budget deficit as quickly as possible in the next parliament starting in 2020. Rumours of the death of austerity (are) greatly exaggerated, Osborne s former top adviser Rupert Harrison said.Looking further ahead, the government will invest 1.0-1.2% of GDP on economic infrastructure from 2020, up from 0.8% now, Hammond said.To soften the hit to living standards for poorer households, the government said it would raise the minimum wage, partly reverse planned cuts in benefits for low-earners and curb fees on renting property.Shares in leading estate agents tumbled after Britain said it would ban one-off tenant fees to try to bring down the cost of renting, the latest move to hit landlords.It will also extend a freeze on tax on vehicle fuel.To make up for some of the extra spending, the government announced the latest increase in a tax on insurance premiums.Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said lower real earnings for workers and overall benefit cuts meant the poorest third of households face a fall in living standards by the end of the decade. Despite increasing borrowing elsewhere, the Chancellor has left the big welfare cuts intact and chosen not to provide significant support for the just managing families that Theresa May has rightly said she is focussed on, he said.Additional information by Reuters(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
