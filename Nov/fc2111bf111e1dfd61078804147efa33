The groups have brought an application to force President Jacob Zuma to suspend NDPP Shaun Abrahams. PRETORIA Civic rights groups, Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation are arguing that their application is urgent as the integrity of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is at stake.The groups have brought an application to force President Jacob Zuma to suspend National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams.They also want advocates Torie Pretorius and Sibongile Mzinyathi to be suspended because of their handling of the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Advocate David Unterhalter, who is representing Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation, says Abrahams needs to be stopped in his tracks to prevent further damage to the NPA.He says Abrahams defended the merits of the charges against Gordhan, So he either knew the content, or backtracked, or he didn t know the contents.Unterhalter says the matter is urgent because it is like putting a pilot back into the cockpit while knowing he is incompetent.The judges have questioned whether Abrahams s decision to review the charges had any impact in terms of regaining the institutions integrity.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
