Cellphone records show the numerous times Brian Molefe visited the Guptas, but he could have been at a sheeben... JOHANNESBURG South Africans have gone up and down the streets of Saxonwold in Johannesburg in search of Brian Molefe s drinking spot.But what did he actually say?The Eskom CEO mentioned a shebeen while responding to allegations made in the Public Protector s report titled State of Capture.The report shows how investigators used cellphone records to illustrate with diagrams the numerous times Molefe visited the Guptas in Saxonwold.According to the report, between 2 August 2015 and 22 March 2016, Molefe also called Ajay Gupta 44 times and Gupta called Molefe 14 times. (Could they have been discussing how much to spend at the 'two streets away' sheeben?). My cellphone reflects that I was in Saxonwold 14 times, close to the herd of proverbial goats. My cellphone reflects I was in the area, Molefe said. There's a shebeen there, two streets away from the Gupta [home]. I will not admit or deny that I've gone to the shebeen. But there is a shebeen there.&quot; These statement prompted people to go in search for this shebeen.Some claim to have located, others are still searching for it, while the rest have an idea of what goes down there.When Brian Molefe says next round is on him at #SaxonwoldShebeen pic.twitter.com/Ch0ZxmOkA0Mood at #SaxonwoldShebeen before #StateCaptureReport #BrianMolefe # pic.twitter.com/MlpZXqpQ5EWhen you get that text from #Brianmolefe from #SaxonwoldShebeen showing buckets full of beer and you at that time pic.twitter.com/2THqQKP0jMWhen it&#39;s a early knock off at work and you just warming up to go to #SaxonwoldShebeen #Eskom #BrianMolefe #ANCNEC pic.twitter.com/gelWDUAXvKHow they will be arriving at #SaxonwoldShebeen tonight. pic.twitter.com/BcDnA9QjTt
