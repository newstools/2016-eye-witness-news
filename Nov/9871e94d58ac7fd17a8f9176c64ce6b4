President Jacob Zuma will be in the House to respond to a set of six questions from Members of Parliament. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) has requested National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete not to preside over a question session with President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday. President Zuma will be in the House to respond to a set of six questions from Members of Parliament.DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says the party also wrote to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in his capacity as Leader of Government Business with regard to their request. She has shown blatant bias against the opposition, and once again used her position to defend President Jacob Zuma and has trampled on both rules of Parliament as well as the Constitution. We believe that she has proven time and time again that she is not fit to be the speaker of the National Assembly. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
