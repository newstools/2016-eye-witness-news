On Friday, President Jacob Zuma said that he himself is not a thief but knows of those who are stealing. JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties have called on President Jacob Zuma to report corruption and its perpetrators following his statements that he knows those who steal from the state.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) say the President has a legal obligation to report criminal behaviour to law enforcement authorities and are therefore calling on him to do so immediately.While addressing African National Congress ANC supporters on Friday, Zuma said that he himself is not a thief but knows of those who are stealing.EFF s Mbuyiseni Dlozi says Zuma must report the crimes before they lay charges against him for knowing about a crime and not reporting it. We are calling Zuma and Dudu Myeni to immediately report the people they keep mentioning who are stealing public funds. We do this because if they do not, we will be taking steps to bring charges against them. Meanwhile, the DA s Mabine Seabe says they are not surprised at the President s statements, but are concerned that he has not reported the crimes which is a contravention of the law. We are concerned that President Zuma has not reported these known crimes to the police and this is in violation to the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. We then call on the Hawks, who are investigating matters of state capture to extend their investigation to these statements that Zuma has made.
