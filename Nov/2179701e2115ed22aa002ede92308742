City officials say over the past 22 years road upgrades in previously disadvantaged areas were done with haste. JOHANNESBURG The City of Johannesburg (CoJ) says it will have to revisit the issue of road maintenance upgrades and commuter shelters, and has blamed the poor roll out of these shelters, on the previous African National Congress administration.City officials say over the past 22 years road upgrades in previously disadvantaged areas were done with haste and sidewalks, storm water systems and commuter shelters were excluded. The new DA administration took over after the local government elections in August this year.During his tenure former Johannesburg Mayor Parks Tau released a statement saying the City has a responsibility to establish and designate ranks, holding areas, stops, shelters and lay-bys for the provision of public transport. The city said it would be rolling out new commuter shelters from October 2012 across the city.Officials said their plans were to roll out ten shelters each month - and that the roll out would take two years.But, the new DA administration says only 327 of the 1 400 commuter shelters have been erected so far.CoJ transport chairperson Nico de Jager says he is not surprised. The transportation department at the time did not allocate the required number of sites in good time. De Jager also says complete streets are not about bicycle lanes, as previously suggested, but about those that walk and those who use public transport and private cars.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
