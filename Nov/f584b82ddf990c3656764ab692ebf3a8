Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor allegedly made defamatory statements about her department and family on social media. JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says she s filing a lawsuit against former African National Congress member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor, claiming she made defamatory statements about her department and family on social media.Mentor claims R42 billion went missing from the ministry in one financial year and says that Motshekga s 22-year-old son drives a Lamborghini.The minister says that these are blatant lies targeting her reputation and the progress she s made in terms of service delivery.Her spokesperson Troy Martens says Motshekga wants to defend and clear her name. We ve been working extraordinarily hard to address infrastructure backlogs over the past three years, especially with the norms and standards. This kind of lie that s being spread has actually gone viral over Facebook and it s counter-productive to what we re trying to achieve. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
