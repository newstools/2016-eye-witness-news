Lesetja Kganyago says cash-strapped South Africans have faced significant fuel price increases over the past two months. JOHANNESBURG - Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago says motorists could expect a significant decrease in fuel prices in December.He has announced that the repo rate will remain unchanged at 7% and that there is good news at the pumps.The governor says cash strapped South Africans have faced significant fuel price increases over the past two months. The domestic price of 93 Octane petrol increased by accumulative 88 cents per litre in October and November with almost all of the increases due to higher international product prices. He says the petrol price looks set to decrease by around 44 cents a litre. The current over recovery indicates that should current trends persist, about half of that increase could be reversed in December. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
