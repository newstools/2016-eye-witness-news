Residents from Woodstock face being evicted from their homes in Bromwell Street. CAPE TOWN - Some Woodstock residents who face being evicted from their homes in Bromwell Street say they're dead set against being moving to a so-called temporary relocation area near Melkbosstrand.Community members visited the site yesterday. The area where they currently live has been bought by a private developer.More than 400 corrugated zinc green and beige structures have been erected on the barren and rocky terrain known as Wolwerivier.Bromwell resident Mische Nel has expressed her apprehension about what could possibly be her new home.Meanwhile, some Wolwerivier community leaders were surprised to hear that more people are expected to move to the area, saying most units are already being shared by more than one family.Human rights group Ndifuna Ukwazi has since applied to the Western Cape High Court to rule that the City of Cape Town has a constitutional obligation to assist those being evicted.In response to the latest developments, the city says it will only comment following the court's ruling on Wednesday.WATCH: Bromwell Street residents speak out about their plight (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
