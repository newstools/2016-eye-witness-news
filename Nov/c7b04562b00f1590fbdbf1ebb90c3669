CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma has hit out at the State of Capture report, telling Parliament that the process had been unfair to him and that the probe was carried out in a funny way .Zuma, who has denied any wrongdoing, also told Members of Parliament (MPs) that the Public Protector could not prescribe to him over setting up any judicial commission of inquiry into the report.The president says the usual procedure of giving those implicated an opportunity to first respond to a preliminary report wasn t followed. This report has been dealt with in a very funny way. Very funny, in my view. It affected me, and many. No fairness at all. Zuma says that, given his views, he can t immediately give the go ahead for the judicial commission of inquiry recommended by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.He s also unhappy about Madonsela directing that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to choose the judge to lead it. No one, no matter what position they hold, can instruct the president to establish a commission and even tell the process through which you must go. It s very funny I ve never heard of it. So that s a problem that we re faced with in regard to this report. State of Capture 14 October 2016 by eNCA.com on Scribd(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
