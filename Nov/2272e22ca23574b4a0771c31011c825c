The Ekhurleni and Tshwane municipalities have escalated rationing in their regions, cutting off water between 9pm-5am. JOHANNESBURG Johannesburg Water says it has decided to keep restrictions at level 2 because continuous supply minimizes burst pipes.The Ekhurleni and Tshwane municipalities have escalated rationing in their regions, cutting off water between 9pm in the evening and 5am.The Water and Sanitation Department has announced that water will be released from the Sterkfontein Dam into the Vaal River system which supplies the province s metros.Environmental infrastructure MMC Anthony Still says there has been an improvement in the saving of water but the situation remains critical. We started off with about 5% down to 1% of savings; now we have about 10% of savings, so residents are taking it seriously. We need to get to 15% of savings, but we think we are getting there. At the same time, chairperson of the portfolio committee on water Lulu Johnson says the Sterkfontein intervention should not be taken for granted. We have a number of industries that are supplied, or that are dependent on the Vaal River system. We talk about Sasol, we are talking about a number of industries and also some mines, apart from domestic use. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
