The investigation into billions of rand wasted by the OR Tambo District Municipality has been delayed. JOHANNESBURG - The Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) has raised concerns over a delay in the investigation into billions of rand wasted by the OR Tambo District Municipality in the Eastern Cape.A committee set up nearly three weeks ago has been tasked with establishing how the municipality managed to incur R3.8 billion in unauthorised, irregular and fruitless expenditure over the past five years. This was contained in the Auditor General s report.While a Democratic Alliance councilor sitting on the committee says there is a lack of urgency from members to call its first meeting, the PSAM has questioned the legitimacy of having an internal probe.The agency's Lungile Penxa says the outcome runs the risk of being biased. The majority of committee members are ANC members and a few DA members. I don t think it s helpful. For it to be meaningful it has to be an independent committee. However, Thembalihle Xhangayi, the only DA councilor on the committee, says they are running out of time. We want all people involved to be held accountable and dismissed. The municipality is yet to respond.Visit EWN's special municipal spending portal - created in partnership with the Auditor-General - to see how your taxes are being spent at local government level.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
