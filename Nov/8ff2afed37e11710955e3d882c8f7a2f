They also set the place alight in two places, which we luckily managed to extinguish. We were thrown with bottles; I have a cut on my arm. My father was hurt and some of the other staff were hurt. Whenever you try to see whether the masses have passed, they throw stones again. EFF supporters also clashed with police, who used stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons - to disperse the supporters after they apparently tried to force their way onto the lawns of the Union Buildings. WATCH: EFF Shuts down Pretoria in #ZumaMustFall marchThere were chaotic scenes outside the seat of government as EFF supporters wanted to access what they called their property .After being denied access, Malema then addressed supporters on the State of Capture report. She (Thuli Madonsela) makes points about (Des) van Rooyen, she makes points about (Mosebenzi) Zwane and she makes points about Eskom. The evidence that she came across is very worrying evidence.
