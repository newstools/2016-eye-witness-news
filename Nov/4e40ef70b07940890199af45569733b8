Julius Malema says because Parliament and President Jacob Zuma are illegitimate, there is only one solution to fix this. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has called for the dissolution of Parliament and early national elections, saying the country is no longer a constitutional democracy.Malema was addressing supporters after appearing in the Newcastle Magistrates Court earlier today on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 by urging supporters to invade land.He made the remarks in the area earlier this year while addressing hundreds of supporters on the party s 61st anniversary of the Freedom Charter.Malema says that by failing to take action against President Jacob Zuma following the Constitutional Court judgement on Nkandla, Parliament undermined the Constitution. Once you say the Constitution is not enforceable, you mean South Africa is no longer constitutional democracy. He says because Parliament and President Zuma are illegitimate, there is only one solution to fix this. Parliament must be dissolved; we must go to early election so that we have a legitimate Parliament. Malema believes if government refuses to hold early elections, it would be showing the Constitution the middle finger. The EFF leader also says no white person is a rightful owner of land in the country and that white minorities must be warned that his party will take the land by whatever means necessary. We will take our land and it doesn t matter how. It is becoming unavoidable and it is becoming inevitable. The land will be taken by whatever means necessary. This land will be returned to black people. He says white people mustn t get confused. Rightful owners, unashamedly are black people and no white person is a rightful to owner of land here in South Africa. Malema added that 1994 means nothing without land.
