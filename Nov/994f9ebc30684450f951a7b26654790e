Officials say they&#8217;ve made the decision because some residents are not using water sparingly. JOHANNESBURG - Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says due to a lack of willingness from some to use water sparingly, her department has cut 15% of supply to municipalities in Gauteng.Mokonyane held a media briefing in Johannesburg yesterday to give feedback, following her meeting with all nine water boards in the country.She says the Vaal Dam is currently sitting at 26% of usable water, but it will affect dam infrastructure should it reach 25%.The entire Vaal River system consists of 14 dams which are sitting at 49%.The minister says they ll have to implement restrictions. Even with this 15%, we can still live with the water that we have if we behave differently. Those who are in authority must manage our water systems properly. She says that municipalities must communicate on time regarding water shortages.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
