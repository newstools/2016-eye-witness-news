Tokyo Sexwale has appointed Advocate Geoff Budlender to investigate possible corruption at Trillian. JOHANNESBURG - Trillian Capital non-executive chair Tokyo Sexwale is warning corruption has reached boiling point in the country. He also insists an investigation into claims against the company will set the record straight. Earlier today, Sexwale announced Advocate Geoff Budlender will investigate claims that Trillian knew of the axing of former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene two months before it actually happened.The Sunday Times recently reported that the company, which it claims is Gupta linked, knew of the axing of Nene two months before it happened, and scored millions of rand for work it never did. The Sunday Times reported that a whistle-blower s affidavit to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela laid bare how Trillian CEO Eric Wood briefed the company s top executives about Nene s axing during a meeting at its Melrose Arch offices in October last year. The paper also claimed senior members of the firm told staff that Des Van Rooyan was going to give them contracts when he became finance minister, a position he held for four days after President Jacob Zuma fired Nene. Sexwale says Wood, who previously denied the allegations, along with other executives have assured him they will cooperate with investigations. I was assured that they will participate and co-operate with the investigation because this is now a public matter. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
