CAPE TOWN Embattled African National Congress provincial chairperson Marius Fransman has accused top party members of trying to get rid of him by ruining his political career.The party's National Disciplinary Committee gathered in Cape Town this past week, to probe allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him.In January this year, Louisa Wynand, a woman he hired to work for him, claimed he fondled her and made her share a bed with him during a road trip to the North West.The embattled leader claims he requested documents with regard to sexual harassment charges laid against him from Secretary General Gwede Mantashe on several occasions.According to Fransman, Mantashe agreed to give him the documents.He however says he's still not received it. The questions is who is trying to get rid of me as the leader and why? Fransman adds, the matter should also have probed three months after the allegations were levelled. The accused said whatever she said with no recourse of being cross-examined, clearly that is devoid of all process. He is adamant that there is a plan to get rid of him before the 2017 elective conference.
