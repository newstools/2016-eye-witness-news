In a briefing yesterday at Parliament, Shaun Abrahams reiterated that he doesn&#8217;t intend resigning. CAPE TOWN Embattled National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams faces a grilling today when he appears before Parliament s Justice Portfolio Committee.This week he announced that criminal charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former South African Revenue Services (Sars) executives, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula, have been withdrawn. He s been summoned to explain to Members of Parliament the circumstances surrounding his initial decision to charge the three and his subsequent about-turn.In a briefing yesterday at Parliament, Abrahams reiterated he that doesn t intend resigning. Do I intend stepping down? I haven t considered that yet. I haven t considered whether it s necessary for me to step down, but I ll always do what s right. That s the oath that I ve taken from the commencement of my career. I ll always do what s right. Abrahams has been the subject of many memes on social media and has been mocked by cartoonists, with many ridiculing his eyebrows and labelling him Shaun the sheep .He said he was very mindful of the narrative put out by the media when he first announced the decision to charge Gordhan. I don t think any senior government official, senior leader of an institution or politician has even been subjected to such an attack in public. I ve been very mindful of it. Abrahams said he s not on social media, but is aware that he is public enemy number one. It tells you where we ve come to as a nation and as a people, when people resort to taking things to such a personal level. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
