Ipid confirmed that acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is being investigated but declined to provide any further details. PRETORIA - Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane s office says they've not been told by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) that the lieutenant general is under investigation. Earlier on Wednesday, Ipid confirmed that Phahlane is in fact being investigated, however, the police watchdog declined to provide any further details related to the case. It is understood that the top cop is accused of interfering with witnesses who were being questioned in a probe into his house at an upmarket estate in the north of Pretoria.The police s Mashadi Selepe says Ipid has not informed the lieutenant general of the investigation. Nothing has been brought to the attention of the national commissioner yet so any investigations that are levelled against him, we shall receive them. But currently we are not aware of any. An Ipid official told Eyewitness News that Phahlane is scheduled to provide investigators with a warning statement on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the South African Police Union says its shocked to learn that Phahlane is being investigated, saying he is a man of great integrity. The union says its concerned that this is an attempt to destabilise the police and has called on Ipid head Robert McBride to personally oversee the case. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
