Louisa Wynand says her life hasn&#8217;t been the same since she brought the sexual assault claims against Marius Fransman. CAPE TOWN - The woman who accused embattled African National Congress (ANC) provincial leader Marius Fransman of sexual assault says it s hard being judged.The party s national disciplinary committee yesterday announced Fransman had been suspended for five years.The committee had found Fransman guilty of abusing his power by trying to obtain sexual favours from his former assistant Louisa Wynand and for making public statement which brought the ANC in disrepute.Wynand says her life hasn't been the same and she fears the situation has tarnished her reputation. My family has been a very good support structure for me at times when I feel really down. I can go to them at any time and we ll sit and just be us. The woman says she's been lambasted by scores of people on social media platforms. It mostly happens on Facebook and that s why I don t use it. I just removed myself from that equation, but people on Facebook were super nasty, there we a few ugly comments. A case of sexual assault against Fransman is still pending in the Northern Cape.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
