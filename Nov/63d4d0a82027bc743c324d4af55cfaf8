Environmental lobby groups &amp; opponents of government's nuclear proposals are preparing to challenge the energy plans in court. CAPE TOWN - Environmental lobby groups and opponents of government's nuclear proposals are preparing to challenge the energy plans in court.The Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute is among the organisations opposing government's energy strategy over it claims is dangerous and lacks public involvement.The matter will be heard in the Western Cape High court in two weeks. The institute's Liz McDaid says: Government is going ahead with its nuclear bill, they are not being transparent, people want to know what s going on. We ve got hidden information and they ve already spent R200 million on studies and consultants that are earning obscene amount of money for something we don t need. Earlier today, environmental activists staged a silent vigil outside Parliament to hand over a memorandum of grievances drafted by some Karoo residents adversely affected by nuclear waste.McDaid adds the nuclear strategy can be reconsidered for viable alternatives. Right now we got more renewables coming on. We got Ingula Pumped Storage and Medupi which is sort of limping into operation. There s enough power and again we have to ask about the cost.
