Malema addressed supporters yesterday outside the Union Buildings after the report was released.Malema says if there is anything to learn from the state capture report, it is that President Zuma can t be trusted. This guy must now be removed from office because he s not fit to occupy that office, because it requires a person with particular skills. So the man is deep into the pockets of the Guptas and the demand for him to go is justifiable. Malema says the process of appointing a commission of inquiry requires a clean president. You can t say the same crew you re investigating must be the one that appoints the people who are going to investigate him.
