President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered an investigation into a human right&#8217;s group&#8217;s report on sexual crimes in IDP camps. ABUJA President Muhammadu Buhari has directed Nigeria s Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to investigate allegations of sexual abuse in Internally Displaced (IDP) camps, across the country. The Nigerian president also directed governors, in whose states the camps were located, to immediately commence investigations into the matter.This followed the international human rights group, Human Rights Watch, report published Monday wherein it accused the Nigerian government of not doing enough to protect affected women or punish the officials involved.The rights group stated that it had documented an estimated 43 cases of rape and exploitation of women and girls in several IDP camps in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital.President Muhammadu Buhari is worried and shocked by the report.Senior researcher for Human Rights Watch Nigeria Mausi Segun says: Within a two-year period, it looks as if it has been going on systematically at different places, at different times. We did write to the authorities as soon as we completed our research at the end of July. We presented a summary of our findings to the government. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
