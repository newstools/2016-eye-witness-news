When I left Liverpool, I came to Los Angeles with the goal of helping the Galaxy lift another MLS Cup, the 36-year-old Gerrard said in a statement on the Galaxy website. I am of course disappointed to have not achieved that objective, but I can look back at my time at the club with pride at what we accomplished, including two straight playoff appearances and countless memorable moments on the pitch... I am now looking forward to spending time with my family as I consider the next stage of my career. Gerrard, who scored five goals in 34 appearances during his 18-month spell in the US, did not confirm whether he would seek to continue his playing career or move into coaching.He has been linked with a coaching position at Liverpool, where he spent 17 years as a player and lifted the Champions League in 2005 as captain. It s certainly not the end of things for me in football terms, I have got a lot of things to consider and I m sure I ll be back involved in the coming months, Gerrard said in an LA Galaxy video. I ve got options on the pitch and off the pitch, I have got a bit of thinking to do in the next few weeks.
