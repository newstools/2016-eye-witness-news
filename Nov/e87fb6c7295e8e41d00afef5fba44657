A Sunday newspaper reported Des Van Rooyen visited the Guptas 7 days in a row before his appointment as finance minister. JOHANNESBURG - Co-operative Governance Minister Des Van Rooyen's lawyer says he launched another application on Monday to interdict the release of the state capture report because the Public Protector did not confirm if weekend reports about him were true or false.The Sunday Times reported that Van Rooyen visited the Gupta family seven days in a row before he was appointed finance minister for a brief stint last year.Van Rooyen was initially assured by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela that he wasn t implicated in the state capture report but this article raised suspicions that he might be.His lawyer Stephan Du Toit says the minister does not oppose the release of any other parts which do not relate to him. The narrow relief which Mr Van Rooyen asked, namely that he be given in respect of this report to the extent that it refers to him, in other words, publish the report but just don t refer to me. Advocate Dali Mpofu who is representing the United Democratic Movement and the Congress of the People as intervening parties in the matter, says Van Rooyen is just an &quot;exhibit&quot; in this case and the main person is President Jacob Zuma who wants to halt the release of the report. Just on the basis of common sense, if one looks at the investigation, then it is really against the president; with respect, Minister Van Rooyen in that mix is merely just an exhibit, a piece of evidence.
