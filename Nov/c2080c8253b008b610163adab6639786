The ANCYL says MPs who fail to show up for Parliament or sleep during proceedings must be shown the door. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League ( ANCYL) wants members of Parliament (MPs) who fail to show up for Parliament or sleep during proceedings to be shown the door.The youth league says they should be replaced by capable young people of the ANC, who possess the energy and revolutionary discipline required to build an effective ANC caucus and legislature .This comes after the failure to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill in Parliament this week, due to low attendance by MPs.A significant number of ANC members were absent from the House.The ANCYL s Mlondi Mkhize says these members should be sent to old age homes if they feel they're too old to perform legislative tasks. We can t continue to keep people in the National Assembly who neglect their duty in Parliament and continue to sleep. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
