Thabo Mbeki says if government listened to his suggestions, the country may have been able to emerge from its current political space. JOHANNESBURG Former President Thabo Mbeki says if government were to listen to his suggestions on governing a constitutional democracy, the country may be able to emerge from its current political space.The former president was speaking at the Sunday Times top 100 Companies Awards at the Sandton Convention Centre last night where he was the keynote speaker.Mbeki addressed a packed gala dinner where the top 100 Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies were being honoured.The former president told those in attendance that if government had paid attention to the Nkandla judgment earlier this year, it would have served them well. If the political parties which are serving in our National Legislature had discussed this observation or I suggest honestly and seriously, I believe that this would have made the strategic intervention we need to pull the country out of an unhappy political situation in which it is, and to put us on a course to achieve the quality governance system we visualised. The statesman has called for the country to engage in a national dialogue.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
