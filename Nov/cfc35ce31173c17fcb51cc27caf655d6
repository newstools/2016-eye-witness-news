The former president says the private sector needs to play a bigger role in helping to solve the problems in the country. JOHANNESBURG - Former President Thabo Mbeki has told South African business leaders in the country to question whether their drive to make money at all costs means being ready to subvert constitutional order.Yesterday, Mbeki addressed the audience at the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards in Sandton, where the top performing entities on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are recognised.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was recognised as the business leader of the year, an accolade that is selected by the previous winners of the award.Mbeki's remarks come a week after the release of the public protector's State of Capture report, which details alleged close ties between politicians and the controversial Gupta family. We must act now and do the right thing because time is not on our side. Speaking on debates around state capture, Mbeki says the private sector needs to play a bigger role in helping to solve the problems in the country.&quot;As all of us have seen, the current raging debate about the so-called state capture has brought sharply to the fore questions about the attitude of capital as a whole to the resolution of our country s national challenges, and whether the drive to make money at all costs means that capital is ready even to subvert the constitutional order.&quot;Mbeki also reflected on the state of the country 10 years ago, saying South Africans were arguably more hopeful about the country s trajectory than they are now.&quot;However, the hard reality we face today is that our country is trapped in a general and deepening political, economic and social crisis which has, for many, begun to turn what was an age of hope into an age of despair.&quot;The former statesman, who chose to quote others throughout most of his speech, has called for a national dialogue.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
