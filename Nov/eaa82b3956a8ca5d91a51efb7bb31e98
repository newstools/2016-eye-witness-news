Mariah Carey is feeling ‘depressed’ following her split from James Packer. LONDON – Mariah Carey is feeling “depressed” following her split from James Packer as she initially thought they would get back together. The 46-year-old singer was left devastated when her engagement to the Australian billionaire was called off last month and after presuming they’d get back together; she has now accepted it's over. A source told People magazine: “First the split didn't seem to faze Mariah. It was like she expected things to be fine soon. Now she realises that things aren't fine and not being with James makes her depressed.” Insiders says Mariah - who has five-year-old twins Morrocan and Monroe with ex-husband Nick Cannon - has been going out to take her mind off things. The source continued: “She doesn’t want to sit at home and dwell on it. She is very hurt that he dumped her. She knows she will never be able to find someone like him.” It was recently claimed that Mariah had begged ex Nick for a divorce so she could marry James. The former couple split in August 2014 but their divorce had dragged on because of legal wranglings over the children. But after the Honey hitmaker had met James and got engaged to him, she phoned Nick to ask him to legally end their marriage. A source told the New York Post newspaper: “Nick and Mariah’s divorce was dragging on and on, mainly because of the back and forth between their lawyers. Mariah’s team brought in [famed LA divorce attorney] Laura Wasser, who helped simplify things, but then Mariah called Nick and said, ‘I really want to get married. Will you sign these papers?’ Nick was cool and said, ‘I’m not going to stand in your way. I’ll sign the papers.’He signed in September, because Mariah and James wanted to get married in early 2017.” However, days after her divorce from Nick was granted, Mariah was left heartbroken when her engagement to James was suddenly called off last month.
