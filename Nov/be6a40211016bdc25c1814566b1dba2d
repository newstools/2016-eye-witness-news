Cape Town&#8217;s newest glory boys, Cape Town City, have a chance to spend at least a day at the top of the PSL. JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town City, the city's newest glory boys, have a chance to spend at least a day at the top of the Premier Soccer League, with a win over Maritzburg United on Tuesday night.City is third on the log, on 17 points, two points behind log leaders Bidvest Wits.A win against the team of choice could see them temporarily lead the pack.Eric Tinkler s men have had an impressive run in the league so far this season, winning five games out of nine and beating the likes of African champions Mamelodi Sundowns along the way.Things haven t been all that great for City s rivals, Ajax Cape Town, who are staring down the battle of relegation early into this season.The Urban Warriors are winless in nine games, having only drawn three and losing six, which has left them rooted to the foot of the table and also resulted in the resignation of coach Roger de Sa.They might take some solace in knowing that Free State Stars are also without a victory, with the same number of games.But Ea Lla Koto have a slight upper hand as they are still involved in the Telkom Knockout, which has reached the semi-finals.Ajax take on Platinum Stars at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium and will certainly be hungry for victory to finally get their campaign underway.And there s one other match on the Tuesday night roster, Orlando Pirates will be looking to build on their win against Free State, when they take on the enterprising Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Pirates are likely still working on their recovery from their 6-1 drubbing by Supersport United and the sudden departure of coach Muhsin Ertugral.They will be well aware of the threat posed by Chippa, who recently signed their former striker in Katlego Mashego and victory could see them hover around the top three region.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
