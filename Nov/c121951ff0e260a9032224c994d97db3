The ANC&#8217;s national disciplinary committee found Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct on Thursday. CAPE TOWN - Marius Fransman, suspended African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape chairperson, says a group within the party has made sure he was kicked out before next year's elective conference.On Thursday, the ANC's national disciplinary committee (NDC) announced Fransman's suspension following allegations of sexual harassment in January.The committee found him guilty on two counts of misconduct.The ANC s NDC has found Fransman guilty of abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, as well as making statements publicly that brought the party into disrepute.But Fransman is resolute he is the victim of a political plot, engineered by a group within the ANC aligned to Secretary General Gwede Mantashe. There s a few in a group around Gwede Mantashe who s helping before the national conference next year to get me out. Fransman laments he did not receive the necessary documents to prepare for the NDC hearing as the party claims he did. The NDC is lying to the public about the documents. I didn t receive the documents and said I would not go into a kangaroo court. The ANC is of the view Fransman has not shown remorse for his misconduct.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
