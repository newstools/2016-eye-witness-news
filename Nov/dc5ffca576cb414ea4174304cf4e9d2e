The initial fear when a troika of African countries announced their intention to quit the International Criminal Court (ICC) was that the tribunal would unravel like granny s knitting grabbed by an unruly puppy.Happily, this has not happened.For now, the haemorrhaging has stopped with only Burundi, South Africa and Gambia indicating they re leaving.It could resume when African leaders gather at their summit in January, or if yet another prosecution of an African is announced.The court was established 14 years ago to prosecute powerful figures, politicians and warlords for horrendous acts such as war crimes and genocide.The majority of African nations belong to it, more than can be said of the United States, China and India.It is true that 9 of its 10 current investigations are in Africa, but this not a result of bias.The court can only prosecute where it has jurisdiction and where it has a reasonable prospect of having successful investigations. Today, those cases have been in Africa.This is why the court cannot act in Syria which is currently the greatest source of crimes against humanity on the planet.Harvard Law professor Alex Whiting, who worked in the ICC prosecutor s office, says the most serious challenge facing the court is not disaffected members leaving but getting the major powers to commit to fight against impunity. If you take the long view, countries like the United States and China and Russia have to decide that either joining the court or finding other ways to ensure that there is international criminal accountability in places like Syria and other places around the world. And that is, to bring it back to the question about Africa, that s the real problem. The real problem is not a bias of the court, but the real problem is the uneven justice around the world, says Whiting.The three countries giving notice to the ICC are doing so for different reasons.Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza does not want to be investigated for possible crimes against humanity in his crackdown on opponents following his taking up an unconstitutional third term at the helm.South Africa is angry about being scolded for not arresting Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir - who is on the ICC s most wanted list - when he attended an African Union summit in Sandton last year.Gambia is well, it is just being Gambia. How seriously can one take the claim that the Hague tribunal has become an international Caucasian court? Perhaps President Yayah Jammeh is taking care of matters ahead of an expected crackdown accompanying elections on December. Ironically, the Gambia will still be an ICC member next month and probably next year. So, for now, Jammeh continues to fall under its jurisdiction.Thus far, ICC authorities and several governments have responded to moves from Bujumbura, Pretoria and Banjul by urging those government to reconsider.This might be seen as closing the door after the horse has bolted.However, there is an opportunity for civil society and watchdog groups in those countries to mount campaigns against these misguided decisions by the governments.Jean-Jacques Cornish is an Africa correspondent at Eyewitness News.
