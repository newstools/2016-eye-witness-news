Emergency services across Gauteng are on high alert after six deaths were recorded in Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Weather Service has issued a warning for severe thunderstorms and heavy rains for Gauteng this afternoon and this evening. Emergency services across Gauteng are on high alert after six deaths were recorded in Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg on Wednesday. The damage caused to some of the province s infrastructure led to road closures at major intersections, including the N3 in Linksfield, which was subsequently re-opened. The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) says some of the routes where debris is still being cleared include the N3 in Linksfield, the R55 near Kyalami, the R21 leading to the OR Tambo International Airport, as well as Witkoppen Road. JRA managing director Sean Phillips said: As we clear debris from roads, they are being opened but sometime the closure is because those roads have become unsafe. They will have to remain closed until we carry out repair works which won t be done in a day. In the meantime, metro police have been deployed to divert traffic where necessary. JMPD s Edna Mamonyane said: We would ask motorist to be aware, if you re driving towards a road that is flooded, please don t go towards the flood because you don t know what the water levels are. The City of Ekurhuleni says a joint operation centre has been set up to provide relief after 105 people were left displaced in the informal settlement of Makause near Germiston.
