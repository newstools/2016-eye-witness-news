While big business has questioned whether the proposed R3,500 a month wage is viable, Terry Bell says most can afford it. JOHANNESBURG - Labour analyst Terry Bell says that most South African businesses will be able to afford the proposed new minimum wage of R3,500.At the weekend Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said a panel of advisors had proposed the figure as a starting level - which would be reviewed annually once legislation has been passed.However, unions and opposition parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the proposed figure, while big business has questioned whether the proposed wage is viable.But Bell says most businesses will be able to afford it. You never employ more people than you need, you employ the minimum you can get away with at the best possible weight. &quot;That s the way the system works, so the point is, of course, that businesses are always going to resist cutting into the bottom line and an increase in wages means an increase in costs. &quot;But it will have, in the long term, an effect, obviously, in certain industries.
