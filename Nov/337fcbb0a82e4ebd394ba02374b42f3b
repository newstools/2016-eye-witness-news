The FF Plus&#8217;s parliamentary leader Dr Pieter Groenewald has been today elected as the party&#8217;s new leader. JOHANNESBURG Pieter Mulder has stepped down as the leader of the Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus).Mulder, who took over the reins from Constand Viljoen in 200, announced his decision at the party s congress in Kempton Park on Saturday.The FF Plus s parliamentary leader Dr Pieter Groenewald has been today elected as the party s new leader.Mulder says a fresh approach is needed to take the party into the 2019 national elections. Well I have been leader now for 15 years, being unopposed all the time, I appreciate that the people nominated me. Today again I was unopposed, but the reality is that it s now 2016 and I am not going to be available in 2019. So it s maybe better to be fair and give a new man an opportunity. Mulder who will remain a Member of Parliament, says it s best to hand over the leadership now before the 2019 elections. I decided maybe it s better now that to stay until too close to the election and it s difficult for the new leader to really get hold of the party and get himself a high profile.
