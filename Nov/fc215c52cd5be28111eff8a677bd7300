Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa has not abandoned its position on human rights. CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has defended South Africa s decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC).He said the government repeatedly raised its concerns with the way the ICC was functioning but was not heard.Ramaphosa was answering questions in the National Council of Provinces.The Deputy President says South Africa has not abandoned its position on human rights or the impunity of leaders who commit genocide, war crimes and other serious acts of aggression with impunity. While we remain firmly committed to the objectives of the ICC, we ve publicly and repeatedly expressed concern about the manner in which the ICC functions. Ramaphosa says South Africa s peacemaker role would be undermined if it remained a party to the Rome Statute, which established the court. The withdrawal from the ICC should therefore be understood as a critique of the manner in which the institution has functioned rather than a rejection of the underlying values of that institution.
