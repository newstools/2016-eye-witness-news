The state capture report is believed to expose the nature of the relations between Jacob Zuma, the Guptas and some ministers. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that four opposition parties and Vytjie Mentor can intervene in President Jacob Zuma's legal bid to interdict the release of the Public Protector's state capture report.The report, compiled by Advocate Thuli Madonsela, is believed to expose the nature of the relationships between the president s friends, the Guptas, and himself, as well as several ministers. The court has also struck off the roll Minister Des van Rooyen's application due to lack of urgency.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Congress of the People (Cope), Democratic Alliance (DA) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) have been joined by former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor in opposing the matter, while minister Des van Rooyen and Mosebenzi Zwane have joined to support President Jacob Zuma.The DA has argued that its role and rights in this case should not be questioned because it was the party which brought the complaint to the Public Protector which led to the investigation.The EFF has argued that the report is of national importance because it involves the highest office in the country and the public has a right to know what s contained in it.The UDM argued that Zuma wants to prevent the release of the report because it could be used to impeach him.They have argued that the report must be released due to compelling public interest and say they ll oppose Zuma's application.Van Rooyen's lawyer had argued that the Sunday Times article suggested he was implicated in the report when he had been assured by Madonsela that he wasn t.The judges earlier said nothing had changed in terms of his assurance other than an article being written.The judges indicated they were willing to continue with the application on Tuesday evening but legal representatives agreed that the matter could be stood down.Argument about whether the highly anticipated report should be released will be heard tomorrow.
