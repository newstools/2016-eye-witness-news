The South African Police Union says Ntlemeza&#8217;s alleged interference in the case against Ipid boss Robert McBride is a cause for concern. JOHANNESBURG The South African Police Union (Sapu) has called for legal action to be taken against Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza, saying his actions are a cause for concern. Ntlemeza has been accused of interfering in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) s case against Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride. Apparent emails between Ntlemeza and former NPA boss Mxolisi Nxasana have surfaced. In them, Ntlemeza asks to review McBride's case, demanding that Nxasana return the docket. The union s Mpho Kwinika says: The latest revelations that General Ntlemeza believes he has the authority to wield power over the NPA and its decisions on what cases to prosecute and review, is extremely dangerous and it's a danger to our new democracy.
