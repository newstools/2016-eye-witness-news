The ANCYL has suggested an amount of R5,000 and called for a study on living conditions of some workers. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says while it welcomes the idea to implement a national minimum wage, it rejects the proposed amount of R3,500.The ANCYL has suggested an amount of R5,000 and called for a study on living conditions of mainly general workers, domestic workers and security guards.It says these sectors are highly populated by the youth, who also head households and have many dependents.The league has called on the National Economic Development and Labour Council to ensure that no employer uses a section in the Labour Relations Act that will give them the right to retrench employees.Spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize says: When you look at working conditions and living conditions of some workers you ll realise that some won t even make it with travelling, the price of food and looking after a family. It will not be sufficient. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for government to rather consider a sectoral minimum wage as opposed to a national minimum wage.The DA s Ian Ollis says a one-size-fits-all approach will add to the already high unemployment rate. These sectors would need to have a sectoral wage for a specific sector. The DA is in favour of minimum wages of each sector of the economy and not a one-size-fits-all minimum wage.
