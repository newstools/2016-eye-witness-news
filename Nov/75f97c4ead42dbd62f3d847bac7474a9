Julius Malema has told supporters outside court to prepare to be shocked once the report is made public. JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has welcomed the High Court s ruling allowing opposition parties to intervene in President Jacob Zuma s application to interdict the state capture report.The EFF, the Democratic Alliance (DA), the United Democratic Movement, Congress of the People and former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor are now listed as respondents in the case.They have argued that the state capture report must be released.Malema has told supporters outside court to prepare to be shocked once the report is made public. We are here because we love this country, tonight we ll be here and tomorrow we ll be here, rain or no rain. The report, compiled by Advocate Thuli Madonsela, is believed to expose the nature of the relationships between the president s friends, the Guptas, and himself, as well as several ministers.The DA has argued that its role and rights in this case should not be questioned because it was the party which brought the complaint to the Public Protector which led to the investigation.The EFF has argued the report is of national importance because it involves the highest office in the country and the public has a right to know what s contained in it.The UDM argued that Zuma wants to prevent the release of the report because it could be used to impeach him.At the same time, Minister Des van Rooyen's application to interdict the release of the report has been struck from the roll due to a lack of urgency.His lawyer had argued that the Sunday Times article suggested he was implicated in the report when he had been assured by Madonsela that he wasn't.The judges earlier said nothing had changed in terms of his assurance other than an article being written.
