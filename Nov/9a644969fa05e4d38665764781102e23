S&amp;P Global has lowered Eskom&#8217;s rating by one notch with a negative outlook. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the Eskom board should resign following the parastatal's credit downgrade by ratings agency Standard and Poor s Global.The agency has lowered Eskom s rating by one notch with a negative outlook.The DA says it is more obvious than ever that urgent intervention in the leadership of Eskom is required, adding Eskom is in no position to handle the multi-trillion rand nuclear project.The DA s Natasha Mazzone says the conditions at Eskom have been going from bad to worse, despite repeated claims by Brian Molefe and Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown that all is well at the entity.Mazzone says the downgrade is a vote of no confidence in Eskom and its leadership. I think the board needs to be rehauled and new appointments need to be made to bring stability to the board at Eskom. I think minister Brown must seriously look at tendering her resignation following in the footsteps of Mr Molefe. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
