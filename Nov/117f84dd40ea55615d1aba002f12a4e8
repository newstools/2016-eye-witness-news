Chief Justice Mogoeng says the courts know how to handle cases of a political nature, and when they may and may not hear the cases. JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says there is no cause for concern that political parties turning to the courts to resolve matters could result in a Constitutional crisis, saying the courts are constitutionally obliged to resolve such disputes. The Chief Justice gave the assurance after meeting with representatives from the heads of court as well as the Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio committee in Midrand today. Mogoeng says ideally, the executive and political parties would resolve their issues out of the courts. But they cannot be faulted if they ever get to the point where they are convinced that the only avenue that can do justice to their concerns is the courts. He says the courts know how to handle cases of a political nature, and when they may and may not hear the cases. Mogoeng added that such trust in the courts to resolve often volatile disputes is in fact a tribute to South Africa s Constitutional democracy.(Edited by Neo Koza)
