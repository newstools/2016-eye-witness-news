JOHANNERSBURG Former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke says should land redistribution not be done properly South Africa may end up in a revolt.Moseneke delivered the Annual Helen Suzman Lecture at the Gordan Institute of Business in Johannesburg on Thursday night. The lecture was well attended with stalwarts Ahmed Kathrada and Barbara Hogan among the attendees.Moseneke spoke on a range of issues including South Africa s exit from the International Criminal Court (ICC), the apartheid system, the current government and social justice among other issues.The former deputy chief justice says the state did not implement Section 25 of the Constitution by addressing the land issue properly. He says it could have started by auditing all the land it owns too. We could have produced outcomes that could have been way better than this. We would have destroyed all of these congestions and unconformable living circumstances. Moseneke, however, says both the state and land owners need to address the problem. We can t stand back and say sorry I have the land, sorry, tough luck girls and boys. You know why, we re going to get involved ultimately. Mosaneke says it is a historical fact that most of the land is owned by white people, which he says is unjust.(edited by Leeto M Khoza)
