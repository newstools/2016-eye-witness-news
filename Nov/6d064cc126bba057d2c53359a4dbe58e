The NPA head stuck to his guns in saying he and the NPA's office have not been captured by anyone. CAPE TOWN - National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams says he will present documents relating to the NPA's case against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to Parliament, if requested to do so.Abrahams stuck to his guns in saying he and the NPA's office have not been captured by anyone.He says he has no plans to resign, despite several calls for him to do so, including from members of Parliament yesterday.Abrahams continued to deny a meeting with President Jacob Zuma at Luthuli House last month affected the NPA's decision to prosecute Gordhan, Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay.ANC MP Makgathatso Pilane-Majake told Abrahams there's nothing wrong with visiting the party's headquarters. Working for the NPA, it means you re an MP and rolling out the mandate of the ANC as the ruling party. Freedom Front Plus' Corn Mulder questioned Pilane-Majake's statement, leading to committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga intervening. I heard a member of the ANC state that it s the task of the NPA to rollout the programme of the ruling government. If that is the case, it is shocking. Pilane-Majake refused to answer the question and the matter was eventually dropped.WATCH: Shaun Abrahams in the wake of the Gordhan charges(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
