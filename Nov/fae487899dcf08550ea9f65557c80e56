KBPresident Zuma says progress has been made to speed up economic growth in the country. R1.4 billion has been committed by the private sector to support small business enterprises. Companies have pledged to offer internships to one million young work seekers. He says South Africans have the tendency of politicising downgrades from ratings agencies which is why there s a perception that the economy is in such a bad state.The President says government is working closely with ratings agencies but what s happening in the country also happens elsewhere in the world.
