The opposition party says the downgrade from BB to BB+ is a vote of no confidence in the power utility and its leadership. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance says it is seriously concerned that Eskom has received a corporate credit downgrade from BB to BB+ by ratings agency Sstandard &amp; Poor's.The opposition party says the downgrade is a vote of no confidence in the power utility and its leadership.The DA s Natasha Mazzone says the conditions at Eskom have been going from bad to worse, despite repeated claims by the current board, Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe and Minister Lynne Brown that all was well at the entity.Mazzone says if Eskom is not run efficiently it has the power to bring the country to its knees. We went from a BB to a BB+ downgrade. I think that this is indicative of the fact that the leadership at Eskom is in turmoil, the company itself is in turmoil. It s most worrying when a company the size and magnitude of Eskom is downgraded, as this is indicative of the sad sate our economy finds itself in.
