The Sars commissioner is accused of allowing Sars to be captured and used by forces outside the state for their own benefit. JOHANNESBURG South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane has been described as a national disgrace for allegedly allowing Sars to be captured and used by forces outside the state for their own benefit. The comments were made at the launch of the book Rogue in Pretoria last night. Former Sars officials Adrian Lackay and Johan van Loggerenberg authored the book which unravels the now discredited series of newspaper reports about the so-called Sars rogue unit . Spokesperson and co-author Adrian Lackay says as Sars commissioner, Pravin Gordhan built a formidable public administration institution. We were proud to play a small role to the development of our country. All of that changed when this character, Tom Moyane, was appointed by Jacob Zuma to be the Sars commissioner. Anglo Gold Ashanti chairman Sipho Pityana is highly critical of Sars new leadership. Lehae la Sars is a house of shame. Its commissioner is increasingly emerging as a key figure in the state capture project. He is a facilitator of crime and corruption, and a national disgrace. Pityana says it s up to South Africans to stop corruption.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
