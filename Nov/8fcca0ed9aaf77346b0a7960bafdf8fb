Brian Molefe says Thuli Madonsela didn't give him an opportunity to explain his relationship with the Gupta family. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO Brian Molefe says he will explain his friendship with the Gupta family and claims of a conflict of interest at the right time.The utility held a special briefing today to present a number of facts that it says were not included in the Public Protector's State of Capture report.The former Public Protector's report was released on Wednesday, revealing that Eskom made certain deals with the Guptas to benefit the controversial family's companies.It also provides details on the nature of the relationship between Molefe and the Guptas, while outlining the number of times the CEO was placed in Saxonwold.Yesterday Molefe wept while saying he wasn t given an opportunity to explain his side of the story.During today s presentation, Molefe didn't delve into Eskom s position on the Tegeta deal.The utility maintains the R600 million prepayment to the Gupta-owned company for coal was above board and helped avoid load shedding.Molefe says he would have explained his friendship with the Guptas to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela if she had given him an opportunity to do so. She never raised it with me, she never asked me what is your response to that? because we never had a meeting. It is a matter I would have liked to discuss with her to and to establish with her what the nature of the conflict was, or to explain myself at the right moment, because now I will take legal advice. At the right moment, I will explain that. Eskom says it will consider taking the report on review.
