JOHANNESBURG - Freedom Under Law (FUL) says it doesn t believe there s anything sinister about the Presidency not receiving its letter, asking for National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams to be suspended.A week ago, FUL and the Helen Suzman Foundation wrote to President Jacob Zuma, asking that an inquiry be instituted into Abrahams fitness to hold office.The two groups also wanted the prosecutors, Sibongile Mzinyathi and Torie Pretorius, responsible for the Pravin Gordhan decision, to be suspended.Yesterday, the Presidency issued a statement, saying it had no record of receipt of the correspondence and the matter would be attended to once the letter had been delivered.FUL s Johan Kriegler says the letter was definitely sent. I don t think there s anything sinister, unless you regard an administrative incompetency within the Presidency s office as sinister. Kriegler says there must have been a mistake within the Presidency. I believe that it s quite clearly an oversight of their part.
