President Zuma&#8217;s second wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma is accused of attempting to murder her husband. JOHANNESBURG Andre Roux, lawyer to resident Jacob Zuma s second wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma, says he is concerned that eight months after a docket investigating allegations of attempted murder was opened against his client she has not been brought before court.Ntuli-Zuma and her three children were kicked out of the Nkandla homestead last year by the State Security Minister David Mahlobo for allegedly being involved in a plot to poison the president. Roux says the delay is completely irregular and robs his client of the opportunity to clear her name. As of normally when a charge is laid against a person and there s merits in the charge, then you expect the police or the NPA to either arrest the person or bring them before court. The docket in this matter has allegedly been opened in April 2015, and yet there s been no further developments in the matter. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
