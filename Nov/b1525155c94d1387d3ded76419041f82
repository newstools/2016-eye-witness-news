JOHANNESBURG The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has slammed reports that additional investigators have been brought in to probe a covert South African Revenue Service unit.The City Press reported that the NPA and the Hawks are working to speed up the completion of the inquiry in order to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan again before Christmas.The paper also stated that two more prosecutors had been roped in, which is not normal procedure.But, the prosecuting authority has rubbished these claims saying that the investigations are still ongoing and a decision has not been made to prosecute.The NPA s Luvuyo Mfaku says: That is blatantly not true. There are two prosecutors working on that matter. It s a norm that prosecutors would have a senior prosecutor who works with juniors in this case, we have only two and not four. Earlier today, the NPA issued a statement rubbishing reports that Minister Gordhan will be criminally charged again before Christmas.#NPA statement on #Gordhan charges pic.twitter.com/7njCKunr2n(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
