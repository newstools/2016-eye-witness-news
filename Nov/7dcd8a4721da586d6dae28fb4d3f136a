Japanese peacekeepers, with a tougher United Nations mandate to use force, have landed in South Sudan. JOHANNESBURG - Japanese peacekeepers, with a tougher United Nations mandate to use force, have landed South Sudan.It s the first overseas deployment of Japanese troops with those expanded powers in nearly 70 years.The 350 self-defence force members will replace a previous contingent of Japanese peacekeepers who served in the United Nations mission in South Sudan but didn t have the mandate to use force.The new troops will be tasked with engineering and construction in the capital Juba.For the first time since the end of the Second World War, these peacekeepers will be able to use force to protect civilians, UN staff and themselves.Japanese constitution, drafted under US direction after the war, forbids the use of force in settling international disputes, but the government has reinterpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to use force in some situations.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
