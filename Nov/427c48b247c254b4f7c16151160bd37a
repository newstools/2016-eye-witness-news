CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has confirmed his support for the report and approach of the national minimum wage panel.In a statement released by Treasury on Thursday, Gordhan describes the reports as balanced and constructive in its approach to addressing the challenge of inequality and unemployment .Meanwhile, the minimum wage advisory panel on Friday moved to clear up misconceptions surrounding the stance of the national fiscus and the panel s recommended national minimum wage of R3,500 per month.Co-ordinator of the Wits National Minimum Wage Research Initiative Gilad Isaacs worked with the panel. The National Treasury research shows significant job losses as a result of the institution of the national minimum wage. Some people have seen this finding at odds with the Finance Minister coming out saying it s a balance and thoughtful report. Isaacs believes that the model that the Treasury used is not applicable to the labour sector. One of the reasons I say it s flawed, it s because it doesn t match with any of the international evidence. International consensus is that moderate increases in minimum wage levels do not lead to unemployment.
