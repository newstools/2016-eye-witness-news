Civil society groups have given Zuma until 4pm this afternoon to provisionally suspend the NPA head and two officials. JOHANNESBURG Civil society organisations have given President Jacob Zuma until today to suspend National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams pending an inquiry into his fitness to hold office. Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation wrote to the president with the ultimatum last week after Abrahams announced the withdrawal of charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. In the letter from Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation, Zuma is given until 4pm this afternoon to provisionally suspend Abrahams and prosecutors Torie Pretorius and Sibongile Mzinyathi. Lawyer Webber Wentzel, acting for the two organisations, says they also invite the men to resign from their offices without delay so as not to harm the country s law enforcement institutions any further. The letter says should the president fail to act, they will seek to exercise their rights in law on an urgent basis. This means they will likely go to court and bring an urgent application to force the president to suspend the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). Last year, a similar application to have deputy NDPP Nomgcobo Jiba was struck off the court roll. ABRAHAMS STICKS TO HIS GUNSLast week, Abrahams said he will present documents relating to the NPA s case against Gordhan to Parliament, if requested to do so.Abrahams stuck to his guns in saying he and the NPA s office have not been captured by anyone.He said he has no plans to resign, despite several calls for him to do so, including from members of Parliament on Friday.Abrahams also denied that a meeting with Zuma at Luthuli House last month affected the NPA s decision to prosecute Gordhan, Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
