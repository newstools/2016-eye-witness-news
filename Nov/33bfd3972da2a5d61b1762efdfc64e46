The committee, led by Jacob Zuma, &amp; veterans will discuss the veteran&#8217;s document titled 'For the sake of our future'. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC)'s national working committee, led by President Jacob Zuma, will today meet with the party s veterans for the second time, to discuss the proposed consultative conference and the veterans document titled 'For the sake of our future'.On Monday, the two groups met, describing their meeting as robust, candid and difficult at times.Some ANC stalwarts previously called on Zuma to step down and raised concerns about what they called the declining state of the party under him. Earlier this month, more than 100 senior members of the ANC signed a document titled 'For the sake of our future', which suggested the party hold a consultative conference to rebuild and renew the movement.The ANC and its stalwarts put up a united front at their last meeting, saying there were issues that were difficult to be resolved in one meeting, hence the suggestion to meet again today. The ANC said the two groups have already agreed on many issues and will use this day to discuss the proposed consultative conference.What might also be under discussion is some veterans involvement in the civil society organisation, Save South Africa, that has criticised the president and called on him to step down.Following this meeting, the ANC s national executive committee will sit for the last time this year.
