Judges are expected to rule on whether the state capture report must be made public or not. JOHANNESBURG - All eyes will be on the High Court in Pretoria this morning, as President Jacob Zuma's legal team argues to halt the release of the highly anticipated state capture report.The court is expected to hear arguments in the urgent interdict case, which will determine if the report is released to the public.Yesterday, the panel of judges ruled that the Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters, United Democratic Movement, Congress of the People and former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor are allowed to intervene in the case, listed as respondents.The opposition parties who are now respondents in the case will argue that the state capture report must be released because the Public Protector is obliged to make it public.Zuma's legal team initially wanted the matter postponed, but they ve since withdrawn this bid and will argue that due process wasn't followed when the investigation was conducted.LISTEN: Former ConCourt judge Zak Yacoob weighs in on state capture report rowCooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen also tried to interdict the report by launching a second application this week, but it was struck from the roll yesterday due to a lack of urgency.Van Rooyen's lawyer argued that the Sunday Times article suggested his client was implicated in the report when he was initially assured by Thuli Madonsela that he wasn't.Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has also launched an application to interdict the report, but his case will only be heard next week.Today the judges will hear arguments and are expected to rule on whether the report must be made public or not.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
