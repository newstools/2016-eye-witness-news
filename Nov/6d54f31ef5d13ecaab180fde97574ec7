President Zuma&#8217;s lawyers have indicated they will seek a postponement in the application to interdict the release of the state capture report. JOHANNESBURG Security has been heightened outside the High Court in Pretoria where President Jacob Zuma s application to interdict the state capture report is being heard. The president is expected to ask that the matter be postponed to allow him more time to read through additional affidavits submitted by people opposing his application. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Congress of the People, the Democratic Alliance and the United Democratic Movement have been joined by former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vyjtie Mentor to oppose the matter, while Ministers Des van Rooyen and Mosebenzi Zwane have joined to support the president. At least four police armoured vehicles are parked outside the court, with dozens of police and metro police patrolling the streets. Some members of the EFF have started gathering at the nearby church square ahead of a picket outside the High Court. #StateCapture #EFF supporters continue to sing and dance outside the #PretoriaHighCourt.
