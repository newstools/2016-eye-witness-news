The judge ruled that the 63 Bridge International Academies were not properly licensed. JOHANNESBURG Uganda s high court has ordered the closure of a chain of low cost private schools funded by billionaire businessmen Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. The judge ruled the 63 Bridge International Academies were not properly licensed and provided unhealthy and sub-standard learning conditions. The institutions have expanded rapidly since the first schools were launched in 2008, with the aim of providing cheap, standardised, technology-driven education in developing African and Asian countries.
