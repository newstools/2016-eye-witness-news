McBride and 2 others were accused changing a rendition report to exonerate senior Hawks officials. PRETORIA - The State has dropped all charges against Ipid head Robert McBride and two subordinates for allegedly altering the so-called rendition report.The trio were accused of fraud and defeating the ends of justice for allegedly changing the report to exonerate senior Hawks officials.The trial of McBride and his subordinates was scheduled to start today but the prosecutor told the court that his witnesses were unwilling to testify. It s understood that they claimed their evidence would be inadmissible in court because it is hearsay. The State was expected to call officials from Ipid, the police as well as Werksmans Attorneys, but they have all refused. After consulting with the priority crimes litigation unit, the prosecutor told the court that there was no prospect of success and withdrew the charges. Among them was attorney Sandile July from Werksmans Attorneys who compiled the report into the alleged altering of the Ipid rendition report. Police Minister Nathi Nhleko had commissioned the firm to conduct the investigation and he later relied on the report to suspend McBride. As it has emerged today, July is unwilling to stand by his findings, which were also the basis for the criminal prosecution. It s for this reason the case has collapsed.
