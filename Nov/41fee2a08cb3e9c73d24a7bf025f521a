The office of the Inspector General of Intelligence is supposed to oversee and curb abuse of power by the country's intelligence agencies. CAPE TOWN - Candidates vying for the post of Inspector General of Intelligence have revealed a dismal state of affairs at the watchdog body supposed to oversee and curb abuse of power by the country's intelligence agencies.The Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence has been leaderless since the end of March last year, when advocate Faith Radebe s term expired.It is meant to conduct oversight over the secret service, as well as crime and military intelligence.Among the 10 shortlisted candidates being interviewed for the post are three current employees.Mampogoane Petrus Nchabaleng told members of Parliament s joint standing committee on intelligence that some of the country s intelligence agencies are refusing to co-operate with the watchdog body when it tries to investigate complaints. We are talking about a situation where we were refused access. Our understanding has always been that we can operate, even without an IG (Inspector General). This was corroborated by fellow employee Smanga Jele during his interview. We started engaging the service in terms of review and monitoring, as well as investigations that have been done on abuse of power in the service. But due to the absence of a head of the structure, we were prevented from accessing the services, including having access to any information that is in the hands of the service. Earlier the office s legal adviser Jayashree Govender conceded there were challenges, but that they could be dealt with.The interviews continue today.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
