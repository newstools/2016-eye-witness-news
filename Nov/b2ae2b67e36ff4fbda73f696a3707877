JOHANNESBURG - A group of Wits University students have started a petition to have the institution's vice-chancellor Adam Habib removed as a United Nations &quot;HeForShe&quot; Champion Ambassador. Students say for someone who s supposed to be fighting for the rights of women, the vice-chancellor is failing in his mandate.They claim the university was slow to act in the removal of a student accused of rape. Student activist Xola Nohaji-Mkoko says: The main reason we re requesting this is because we feel like he (Adam Habib) has continuously failed to protect us as vulnerable black female body in the environment of the university. The university has launched an investigation in to the rape allegation, with the first report expected to be released later this week.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
