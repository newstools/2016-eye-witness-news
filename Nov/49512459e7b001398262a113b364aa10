Around 4pm it was at R14.18 to the dollar, R17.62 to the pound and R15.25 to the euro. JOHANNESBURG - The rand has strengthened by around 2% against the dollar after coming under pressure due to the US presidential election. The local currency hit two-month lows after the election of Donald Trump.Around 4pm it was at R14.18 to the dollar, R17.62 to the pound and R15.25 to the euro. Emerging market currencies have been under pressure since the election of Trump last week. Prior to this, the local currency had enjoyed renewed strength trading at levels seen a year ago.But following Trump s election the rand, Mexican peso, Russian rouble and other emerging market currencies lost substantial value.Nedbank economist Isaac Matshego said: We ve seen it recovering a bit on Tuesday but it s still down by around 6%. That is slightly better than the performance of, for instance, the Mexican peso which was down by 11% on Monday. Economists agree that the time is right for a correction for emerging market currencies, saying the levels of the past week are not a true reflection. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
