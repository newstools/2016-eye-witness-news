ANCYL President Collen Maine says they continue to support Jacob Zuma and want to see him complete his term in 2019. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) President Collen Maine has hit back at former public protector Thuli Madonsela s supporters saying President Jacob Zuma will not be removed by the State of Capture report but at rather by the ballot.Members of the ruling party are in Kwadukuza in KwaZulu-Natal where President Zuma is now addressing the cadres forum.The public protector's State of Capture report has called for a judicial commission to investigate allegations that the President's son Duduzane Zuma and the controversial Gupta family have had undue influence over cabinet appointments.Maine says the ANCYL and ANC members continue to support the President and want to see him complete his term in 2019.He says the problem is that the ruling party remains an enemy of white monopoly capital. Our message to the enemy of the revolution, which is the monopoly capital, is that President Zuma did not leave with Thuli Madonsela on 15 October; he is still here with us. We love him, we respect him and we will protect him because he is our President.
