Stats SA has announced that the unemployment rate has increased by 0.5 of a percentage point to 27.1%. JOHANNESBURG - Labour analysts say Tuesday s unemployment figures show that job growth is simply not taking place and government needs to reassess the situation.Stats SA has announced that the unemployment rate has increased by 0.5 of a percentage point to 27.1% despite significant job growth in some sectors. The figures are included in the third quarter labour force survey which was released in Pretoria today. Independent analyst Gavin Brown says the increase in joblessness isn't a surprise. Most observers would be very skeptical of that figure and very much interested in the expand rate of unemployment. Bearing in mind there s no job growth and the fact that we have thousands of matriculants every year entering the job market, it s not a pretty side and I don t think it s anything more than a confirmation of what we re already well aware of. Labour lawyer Michael Bagraim says the figures released today won't have a major impact on the economy for now. I don t think it means all that much, it s a very small increase and the increase itself is not going to make a dent at all when we ve got almost 40% of the South African workforce out of the job.
