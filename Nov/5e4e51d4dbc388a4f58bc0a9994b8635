JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has again hit out at his critics, saying he's viewed as dangerous because he has influence and remains an enemy of white monopoly capital.Zuma was speaking at the Cadres Forum in KwaDukuza in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday, where he questioned the Public Protector's State of Capture report, saying it's now being used to call on him to resign.He says there's no political organisation in South Africa that can take on the African National Congress (ANC), even if they collude with each other.The president has again thanked citizens for voting for the ruling party, saying a percentage decrease is not a disease and democracy continues to be at work.Zuma alluded to some political parties and says they've been &quot;bought&quot; by monopoly capital to influence the way the ANC runs the country because the ruling party remains an enemy to them.He has also once again hinted that he has more information about some of his critics, which he may reveal one day.The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal and the ANC Youth League also came out in full support of Zuma yesterday.ANCYL president Collen Maine says the ruling party has always been an enemy of white monopoly capital, which is why it continues to try and have its president removed.Maine says there's ill-discipline within the ANC and it needs to be addressed as it's allowing the enemy to cause divisions.Maine adds Zuma will not be removed by the state capture report, but by the ballot. President, at all times you must know and be confident that the people of South Africa, led by the ANC, has full confidence in you. They say they ll continue to defend him and want to see him complete his term in 2019.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
