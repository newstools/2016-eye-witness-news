Dignity SA says the topic is complex, but the decision to grant critically ill patients the right to die should be a simple one. JOHANNESBURG - Dignity South Africa says it is confident that it will win its case against government for assisted suicide to be approved.It says the topic is complex, but the decision to grant critically ill patients the right to die, when they choose, should be a simple one.Arguments began in the Supreme Court of Appeal today, with government appealing against a high court ruling last year.Dignity SA says the high court granted Robin Stransham-Ford the opportunity to choose to die based on its interpretation of the Constitution and believes the appeal court will do the same.But the government has criticised the ruling and wants it reversed.Dignity SA's Sean Davison says the case is simply about an individual making a free choice at the end of their lives to end their suffering. What kind of country allows its elderly and terminally ill to suffer so horrendously at the end of life because it s politically controversial? It shouldn t be our country. Stransham-Ford died just hours before the high court ruling was delivered.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
