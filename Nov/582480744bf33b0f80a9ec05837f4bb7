Joseph Odartei Lamptey awarded a penalty to Bafana Bafana because of what he judged to be a hand ball in the box. JOHANNESBURG - The Confederation of African Football (Caf) has suspended referee Joseph Odartei Lamptey for incorrectly awarding Bafana Bafana a penalty in their World Cup qualifier against Senegal.South Africa beat Senegal 2-1 in Polokwane 10 days ago, to go joint top of Group D, but Bafana s victory was partly overshadowed by the controversial penalty, which Lamptey gave because of what he judged to be a hand ball in the box.The Senegalese Football Association appealed Lamptey s decision to Caf following their loss, which has resulted in the Ghanaian official being suspended for three months, ruling him out of the Africa Cup of Nations in January and February.The African football governing body and Senegal s football association have not indicated whether they will request FIFA s involvement in the matter.(Edited by Neo Koza)
