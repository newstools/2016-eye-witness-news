The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa has called on the entire board of Eskom to resign in the wake of the release of the state capture report. JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has called on the entire board of Eskom to resign.The metalworkers' union says while it welcomes CEO Brian Molefe and board member Mark Pamensky's resignations following the release of the S[tate of capture report](http://ewn.co.za/Topic/State-Capture), the board must account in its entirety.Numsa's Patrick Craven says the report proves that all state-owned entities need to be reviewed.Craven says entities such as Eskom cannot continue with business as usual. This whole issue has raised the question of the management of state-owned enterprises. Because the question will arise, if as we said, we want the whole board to resign, who should replace them? To elect another board with similar people will solve nothing. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
