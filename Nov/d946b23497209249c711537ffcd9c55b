CAPE TOWN - Statistician General Pali Lehohla is warning that if government wants to tackle unemployment, a greater investment in tertiary education is needed.He was speaking at the release of the third quarter labour force survey in Pretoria.While there was growth in jobs in some sectors, overall unemployment grew to 27.1%, the highest it s been since 2003. The third quarter labour force survey shows university graduates have labour market absorption rates above 8%.For people with other tertiary qualifications this figure is just above 70%. The matriculant absorption rate is about 50%, while those with less than matric sit at about 30%. Lehohla says policy-makers should pay close attention to these figures. While university education is not going to solve all problems that we have in South Africa, but when you have it, unemployment becomes less of a problem. Given that we need skills, that s the space in which there must be an investment. The overall market absorption rate is about 42% which is still lower than the pre-recession rate of 45% in 2008.The statistician general says there needs to be a targeted approach to developing the specific skills South Africa needs in order to reduce unemployment levels. Lehohla says graduate unemployment is very low. Showing that the economy has the appetite for absorbing those with graduate qualifications and I think if we target those carefully, the levels of unemployment would still be tempered with. He says this will have a positive knock-on effect. The deal here is that people who are graduates create more jobs so the low skills jobs will be created as the consequence of now graduate people needing jobs. The figures suggest government is unlikely to reach its unemployment target of 6% by 2030. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
