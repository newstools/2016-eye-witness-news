The EFF&#8217;s proposal for Thuli Madonsela to address Parliament was backed by most other opposition parties but the ANC argued strongly against it. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament has used its muscle to vote down a call for former public protector Thuli Madonsela to come and address the National Assembly.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) proposal was backed by most other opposition parties but the ANC argued strongly against it.Madonsela s seven-year, non-renewable term expired earlier this month when she handed over the baton to new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.EFF Member of Parliament (MP) Floyd Shivambu argued that it would be a fitting tribute to the woman under whom the Office of the Public Protector acted without fear or favour . This National Assembly must invite Advocate Thuli Madonsela to come and address the National Assembly on a date to be agreed to by the programming committee, but before the end of the annual session of 2016. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu told MPs the convention was that only former heads of state or chief justices had ever had this honour. The farewell function in honour of Advocate Thuli Madonsela organised by the Speaker is sufficient recognition of her remarkable contribution to our people. The ANC opposes the motion. When it came to a vote, there were 89 in favour, 183 against and eight abstentions.
