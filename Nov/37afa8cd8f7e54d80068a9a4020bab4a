The Democratic Alliance has filed a criminal complaint accusing President Jacob Zuma of corruption. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) has filed a criminal complaint accusing President Jacob Zuma of corruption in the wake of the State of Capture report.Advocate Thuli Madonsela s carefully worded report stops short of asserting that crimes have been committed and calls for a judge to investigate the allegations.The State of Capture report has plunged Zuma into the latest crisis of his scandal-plagued presidency.It focused on claims that the Gupta family influenced the appointment of ministers, and called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies acted improperly.Party leader Mmusi Maimane laid the corruption charge at the Rosebank police station on Tuesday afternoon. Maimane s spokesperson Mabine Seabe says: Like any charges that have been laid, an investigation must take place. President Jacob Zuma must be questioned by the police, and if there is a criminal case it must be taken to the National Prosecuting Authority and they must prosecute. President Zuma denies providing special favours for wealthy friends, including the Guptas, who run a business empire from media to mining. The Guptas also deny wrongdoing. At the same time, on Friday Eskom Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe, announced his resignation just a week after he was implicated in the report. Molefe insists his resignation is not an admission of guilt.Read the Public Protector's full State of Capture report below: State Capture Report 2016 by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Tamsin Wort &amp; Masechaba Sefularo)
