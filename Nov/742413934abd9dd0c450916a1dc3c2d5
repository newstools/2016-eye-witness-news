The deputy faced faced tough questions &amp; spirited opposition heckling while answering questions in the National Assembly today. CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa faced some tough questions and spirited opposition heckling while answering questions in the National Assembly this afternoon.Ramaphosa was asked whether President Jacob Zuma, rather than taxpayers, should foot the bill for his legal costs incurred in his bid to block the release of the state capture report.Zuma s lawyers withdrew the application this morning.Ramaphosa was also asked whether he should not ask Zuma to step down.The deputy president appeared taken aback when the question was asked: When you are a deputy to president Zuma, whose presidency is characterised by looting and plunder, don t you think you must lead us and ask the president to resign? #Ramaphosa asked if he shouldn&#39;t lead us and ask Pres Zuma to resign. Doesn&#39;t answer, questioner not a member of ANC GDBut he quickly recovered, though perhaps not to the satisfaction of all MPs. Madam Speaker, I don t think that s a question that deserves an answer from me. The honourable member knows what the processes are. He s not a member of the African National Congress, I think that s his problem. If he was a member of the ruling party, he d know how things are done. Ramaphosa also told the House that the courts will make a decision about the costs of President Zuma s aborted legal action to prevent the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report, which the Democratic Alliance has described as frivolous and vexatious.#Ramaphosa Constitution gives all citizens right to go to court, must be available even to a President. Courts will decide on costs. GDWATCH LIVE: Ramaphosa Q&amp;A in Parliament(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
