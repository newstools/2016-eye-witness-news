A former ConCourt judge says that Shaun Abrahams is not worthy of being the National Director of Public Prosecutions. CAPE TOWN - Former Constitutional Court Justice Zak Yacoob says National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams is not worthy of being the National Director of Public Prosecutions.Yesterday, Abrahams announced he had withdrawn the fraud charges against the finance minister and two former Sars executives. This has led to a flurry of calls for the NPA head to resign.Yacoob says it must have been clear to him that the case wouldn't hold up in court. The interesting thing is why he withdrew the charges. He withdrew because he came to the conclusion that there was no way in which intention could be established. The fraud charges were related to a pay-out made by Sars to former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay when he took early retirement.LISTEN: Should NPA boss Shaun Abrahams fall on his sword over Gordhan U-turn?Abrahams said he had considered a 2009 memo from a Sars legal executive, which found that there were no technical reasons why Pillay could not retire early and be re-appointed.The NPA head, however, defended the initial decision to prosecute, saying that there was a case to answer to.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
