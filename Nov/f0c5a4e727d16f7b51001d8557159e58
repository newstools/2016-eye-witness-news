The Department of Labour in the North West closed the court following an inspection. JOHANNESBURG - The Justice Department in the North West has confirmed the Rustenburg Magistrates Court has been closed, because of health concerns. Earlier this week, the Department of Labour closed the court following an inspection. Officials are concerned about asbestos in the building's roof. Court cases are now being heard in other locations in the city. The department's Tsietsie Malema says it anticipates the court will reopen next year. The Department of Public Works, which is responsible for the maintenance, on Wednesday appointed an approved service provider who is qualified to handle and remove asbestos. They will finish the work next year January. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
