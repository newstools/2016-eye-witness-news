Brian Molefe announced yesterday that he is resigning but says he is not admitting to any wrong-doing. JOHANNESBURG Eskom chair Ben Ngubane says the decision by Brian Molefe to resign as the parastatal s CEO from January is regrettable but understandable.Molefe announced yesterday that he is resigning but says he is not admitting to any wrong-doing.Last week, the Public Protector s report on state capture said it appeared Eskom had tried to push the Optimum Coal Mine into financial distress so the Gupta family could buy it It also found that Molefe had been in regular contact with the Guptas at the time and regularly visited their Saxonworld home.Energy expert Chris Yellend says this resignation could be just the start as the full judicial inquiry into claims of state capture is still to come. I do think that there s going to be a lot of dirty washing, a lot of new facts coming out. We ve not seen half of it in my opinion. But Eskom s board says it wants to thank Molefe for his dedication to turning the utility around and putting it on a sound growth trajectory.Molefe says that he is going to dedicate himself showing that he is the victim of injustice because the Public Protector s observations were published after an incomplete investigation.BROWN SADDENED BY RESIGNATIONPublic Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said she is saddened by the resignation of Molefe but respects his decision.Minister Brown said Molefe has been instrumental in developing Eskom s turnaround strategy and it s disappointing that he won t be around to see it completed.She said she will work closely with the Eskom board to ensure that the company remains stable but says that Molefe leaves a strong executive.The Public Enterprises Minister said that during Molefe s tenure, Eskom managed to connect almost 100,000 houses to the grid with overall revenue increasing.Added to this, she said there have been 460 days with no load shedding.Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance has announced it will be laying charges against Molefe in terms of the Prevention and Combatting of Corruption Act.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
