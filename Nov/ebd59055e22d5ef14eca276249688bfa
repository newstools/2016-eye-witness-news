Gordhan, writing on behalf of his family and himself, says they are all humbled by the support. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has written a letter to South Africans, thanking them for their active and continued support.The minister began the week hearing that the fraud charges levelled against him by the National Prosecuting Authority were being abandoned.The letter, which was published by the Treasury on Friday, coincided with NPA head Shaun Abrahams answering questions in Parliament about his decision to charge and then withdraw the case against Gordhan.In the letter, Gordhan says he is writing on behalf of his family and himself, saying they are all humbled by the support from South Africans.He then goes on to quote parts of the Constitution and says the country has made tremendous progress in all aspects as a young democracy, but that more still needs to be one.Abrahams announced on Monday that he will not prosecute Gordhan Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay.The fraud charges were related to a pay-out made by Sars to Pillay when he took early retirement.He insists his move to charge the trio in the first place was not politically motivated.WATCH: Shaun Abrahams in the wake of the Gordhan charges(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
