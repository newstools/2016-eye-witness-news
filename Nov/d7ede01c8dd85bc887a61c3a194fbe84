The report, titled State of Capture, says the president may have broken the Prevention of Corruption Act. JOHANNESBURG The state capture report titled The State of Capture reveals that President Jacob Zuma failed to act on claims of state capture, that the Gupta family may have known about Des van Rooyen s appointment as finance minister before December, and that a judicial inquiry must be instituted within 30 days.After a bruising two-day legal battle, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that the report be made public today.This report says the president's failure to investigate the claims made by Themba Maseko, Vytjie Mentor and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas mean he may have broken the Prevention of Corruption Act.It also says that it s a source of concern that Cabinet seemed to take an extraordinary and unprecedented step in intervening with the relationship between the big banks and companies that employed his son Duduzane Zuma.In her report, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela also goes through the conduct of Eskom and says it appears that its conduct was solely aimed at forcing the Optimum coal mine into business rescue - and then financial distress.It says that that allowed the Tegeta Company, which is owned by the Guptas, to buy the coal mine.This report also says that Minerals Minister Mosebenzi Zwane s conduct in going to Switzerland to help the Guptas buy the mine appears to have broken the Constitution.LISTEN: Thuli Madonsela on the 'State of Capture' reportWHO ELSE IS IMPLICATED IN THE STATE CAPTURE REPORT?The State of Capture report reveals the names of other prominent figures additional to those of the three Cabinet ministers, the president s son Duduzane and the Eskom board.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, Eskom s Brian Molefe and the board of Eskom were all cited by Madonsela during the state capture investigation.They were told evidence had been collected against them and were afforded an opportunity to respond.According to the report, the board of Eskom was improperly appointed, certain conflicts arose and the minister took no action to prevent these conflicts.The report also shows how investigators used cellphone records to illustrate with diagrams the numerous times Molefe visited the Guptas in Saxonwold.It was found that from 5 August to 17 November last year, Molefe can be placed in Saxonwold on 19 occasions.The number of calls between Molefe and the family were investigated between 2 August last year and 22 March this year.It s been found that Molefe called AJ Gupta 44 times and Molefe called him 14 times.An Eskom spokesperson says they believe that everything the power utility has done has been above board.
