The former ANC chief whip supports Secretary General Gwede Mantashe&#8217;s principle of appealing to Zuma&#8217;s conscience. JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Mathole Motshekga says the ruling party cannot accept collective responsibility for the actions of President Jacob Zuma and all those implicated in the state of capture report.Motshekga has written an open letter where he s called on the president to do the honorable thing and step down, and do some soul searching.He s joined the party s Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu and civil society in calling for Zuma to go.The Public Protector s state of capture report reveals that Zuma failed to act on various claims.Motshekga says the ANC has been put in a difficult position where it must choose between Zuma, the party and the people of South Africa. These controversies, whether they re right or not, are actually damaging the image of the ANC, and the country. Motshekga says he supports ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe s principle of appealing to Zuma s conscience. The ball is in his court to decide whether he heeds the call to resign or not. Motshekga says the founders and ancestors of the ANC will judge the current leadership harshly if it fails to ask Zuma to do the honorable thing.The ANC Member of Parliament (MP) previously formed part of the small National Executive Committee (NEC) task team that coordinated the recalling of former President Thabo Mbeki in 2008.He says, There are people within the ANC like the chief whip Jackson Mthembu, there are 101 stalwarts of the organisation who are saying the same, so it s in the public domain that he must resign.
