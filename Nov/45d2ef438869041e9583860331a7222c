NPA head Shaun Abrahams sent his submissions to the Presidency, explaining why he believes he should not be suspended. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants President Jacob Zuma to make public the representations he received on Monday from National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams.Abrahams, along with prosecutors Sibongile Mzinyathi and Torie Pretorius on Monday handed in submissions to the presidency on why they should not be suspended pending an inquiry. This was after civic rights groups wrote to the presidency asking him to suspend Abrahams. The NPA head sent his submissions to the Presidency, explaining why he believes he should not be suspended from his job as the country s top prosecutor. Neither Abrahams nor the NPA will be making those papers public. But the DA says the public deserves to know the facts surrounding the spectacle of Pravin Gordhan s prosecution and it is of national importance that the president handles the process with complete transparency. It is unclear when Zuma will make a pronouncement on Abrahams s future.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
