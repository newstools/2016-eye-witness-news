The EFF's Reneilwe Mashabela made the comment while delivering a member&#8217;s statement in the National Assembly. CAPE TOWN There ve been ructions in Parliament after an Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP labelled President Jacob Zuma a corrupt thief .Reneilwe Mashabela made the comment while delivering a member s statement in the National Assembly. It is only when the EFF takes over government that our people will have decent houses unlike the African National Congress (ANC) government, under the leadership of the corrupt thief Jacob Zuma who failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution of the republic. She refused to withdraw the comment when ordered to by house chairperson Grace Boroto: I m going to ask you to withdraw the comment from the House .Mashabela responded by saying: The thieves are here. EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi challenged the ruling: There is a ruling of the Constitutional Court that he benefitted unduly in Nkandla, why is he paying back the money if he s not a thief? Mashabela was ejected from the chamber. Her fellow caucus members followed her out, each of them shouting Zuma is a thief .(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
