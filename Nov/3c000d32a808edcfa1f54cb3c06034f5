On Sunday a panel will give a figure on a national minimum wage for South African employees. JOHANNESBURG - The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) says it looks forward to a report on what the national minimum wage will be and will report back to its members who will decide on a way forward.On Sunday a panel which was set up by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will give a figure on a national minimum wage.Fedusa has proposed no less than R4,500 a month, while business has given a figure less than half of that.Some economists have argued the implementation of a standardised amount will help close the inequality gaps and grow the South African economy.Fedusa General secretary Dennis George said, We look forward [to it] and when we receive the report we will go back to our members so we can brief them on the developments and to get a mandate from them, so that we can try to introduce a minimum wage in South Africa as an important instrument to deal with inequality.
