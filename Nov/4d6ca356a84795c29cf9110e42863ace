It s clear that the current leader of the NPA is highly questionable and not fit for office. The DA has already written to the president in terms of Section 12(6) of the NPA Act to request that he suspend Abrahams as NDPP. This is the first step that is necessary in terms of the law we await reaction from the president in this regard. Breytenbach says they ll be taking action in Parliament. The DA will not hesitate to make use of the parliamentary mechanisms available to us, that is having motions passed in both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces in the same sitting, requesting the suspension of Abrahams, this according tothe NPA Act could force the removal of Abrahams. The party says it will also bring a constitutional amendment bill that will involve Parliament in choosing an NDPP, a post that presently is up to the president to fill.MUST WATCH: Shaun Abrahams on political capture, charging a president and more(edited by Winnie Theletsane)
