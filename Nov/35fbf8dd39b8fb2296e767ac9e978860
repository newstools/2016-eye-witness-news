CAPE TOWN - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has warned scams tend to increase over the festive season.The agency says social grant beneficiaries need to be aware of a new scam in which criminals request personal details via SMS.Sassa National Spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko has rubbished claims that new green coloured cards are being issued. If you change your Sassa card and replace it with another card, the danger of that is you will begin to see unauthorised debit coming off your card. He says scammers have contacted some beneficiaries via SMS. So we are saying to our beneficiaries please do not permit. Your Sassa card is still valid up until Sassa requests you to come to their office and that has not happened yet. If it needs to be changed, Sassa will communicate with people properly not through an sms that does not even have a Sassa letterhead on it The agency adds there's a tendency for more scams to emerge leading up to the December holiday season.(Edited by Neo Koza)
