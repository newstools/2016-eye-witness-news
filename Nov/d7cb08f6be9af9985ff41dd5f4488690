NPA boss Shaun Abrahams says he didn&#8217;t cave into any pressure to withdraw charges against Pravin Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG - National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams has denied that the decision to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was a blunder or that he brought the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) into disrepute.Abrahams answered questions in Parliament today about the case and his reasons to initially charge Gordhan and two others. The fraud charges against Gordhan were dropped earlier this week.Abrahams says he didn t cave into any pressure. It s incorrect that I took public interests into consideration when I made the decision to withdraw the charges. Public consideration played no role and I ve made that clear. He says he has previously overruled decisions to prosecute. Matters that I ve agreed with the decisions of the directors of public prosecutions and special directors which I ve reviewed amount to 94. In a further 60 matters I reviewed, I disagreed with the original decision of the directors of public prosecution and special directors and I overruled those decisions.
