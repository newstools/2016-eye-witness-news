This is compared to the R5.6 billion posted the previous year.Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, who was also in attendance, responded to some of the queries from MPs about whether the National Treasury is considering privatising SAA.He says there are a lot of other avenues to consider before such a step will be taken.
