CAPE TOWN In an annual patient survey conducted by her department, Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo visited the Tygerberg Hospital. Mbombo was measuring the quality of services provided at the facility.The MEC chatted to patients in the hospital s waiting area about the quality of services they have received.Overall, most seemed happy with the treatment they receive from doctors, nurses and another hospital staff. A Belhar resident said there wasn't much to complain about. I am very satisfied, it s A-plus service. The doctors are very helpful and they are very respectful towards patients. But, she added, that the one area that needs improvement is the pharmacy where patients have to wait up to about five hours before receiving their medication. This annual survey is set to take place at health facilities throughout the province this month.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
