President Zuma has asked NPA head Shaun Abrahams and two NPA official for reasons why he should not suspend them over their handling of the Pravin Gordhan matter. JOHANNESBURG The Helen Suzman Foundation says it doesn t know why President Jacob Zuma has suddenly acceded to their legal request for him to take action against National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Advocate Shaun Abrahams for the way he dealt with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.On Tuesday, Zuma said he had asked Abrahams, the NPA s Gauteng Head Advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi and Dr Torie Pretorious for reasons why he should not suspend them.All three were involved in the decision to charge Gordhan with fraud, before Abrahams announced he was rescinding the decision.The foundation had already lodged legal papers demanding that Zuma take action against these three officials before the president said on Tuesday that he was now asking them why he should not suspend them.Meanwhile, in his legal papers Advocate Abrahams has included a series of letters he wrote to Hawks head Mthandazo Ntlemeza.The documents show they had an angry legal argument about the case against the Finance Minister.The Helen Suzman Foundation s head Francis Antonie says: It really is the most extraordinary account of that relationship and how things are going very wrong in the state structures. I think Mr Zuma must be aware of some of these stresses and strains. In the letters, Ntlemeza said Abrahams was wrong to give into pressure to stop the prosecution of Gordhan.Read the NDPP's answering affidavit in the application to have him suspended: NDPP Answering Aff by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
