The ANC Secretary General has cautioned state institutions against entering the political terrain, saying it&#8217;s dangerous. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has cautioned state institutions against entering the political terrain, saying it s dangerous for the ANC and the institutions.Mantashe has also reacted to reports that the Hawks are investigating him and other top ANC leaders, saying if that s the case, it s an act of desperation on the part of the institution.Mantashe was briefing the media yesterday following the party s National Working Committee (NWC)meeting.The Hawks have denied a report by the Sunday Times that the crime fighting unit is investigating Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, Mantashe and the party s Treasurer Zweli Mkhize for allegedly failing to report a R600 million bribe apparently offered to Jonas by the Gupta family.Mantashe says while the NWC did not discuss the Hawks, he noted the reports. In our view, it is just an act of desperation. He has cautioned state institutions against meddling with political affairs. It is always dangerous, not only for the ANC, it s dangerous for the institutions themselves. The Hawks say they will wait for the outcome of the commission of inquiry into state capture before taking any action against those implicated in the Public Protector s state of capture report. In the State of capture report, the Public Protector recommends that there be an inquiry into allegations that the Gupta family have influence on the state and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng must appoint a judge to head the commission.The state capture report reveals that President Jacob Zuma failed to act on claims of state capture that the Gupta family may have known about Des Van Rooyan s appointment as Finance Minister before Nhlanhla Nene was axed in December, and has recommended that a commission of inquiry be instituted.Mantashe says the commission must be established constitutionally. As a matter of principle, the ANC supports the setting up of the commission of inquiry. However due regard must be given to the constitutional prescripts that guide the establishment of such a commission. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
