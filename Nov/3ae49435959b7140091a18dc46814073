It says new proposals from the department of mineral resources will impact the industry&#8217;s future viability. JOHANNESBURG The Chamber of Mines says new proposals from the Department of Mineral Resources to institute a new development levy and change the sector s transformation targets will have an impact on whether the industry remains viable in the future.It also says it s worried that the draft reviewed mining charter contains targets that are ill-considered and unachievable, and that government wants to impose them when the industry is essentially losing money.The chamber says it is responding to statements made by Mineral Resources Deputy Director General Mosa Mabuza in Parliament on Wednesday.It says in his presentation it became clear that the department has not included the industry s concerns and objections.The chamber s Tebello Chabana says it appears the department is simply ignoring them. If they were a little more receptive to that we wouldn t have a charter that s not gone through a negotiation process. Mineral Resource Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has been the subject of harsh criticism, after he issued a statement in which he lied by claiming that cabinet wanted the president to institute an inquiry into why the big banks withdrew their services from the Gupta family.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
