The organisation says the declining cost of renewable energy has hampered fracking dreams. CAPE TOWN - The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has rubbished claims by oil companies that 'fracking' in the Karoo will create up to 700,000 permanent jobs.This has been revealed in an environmental assessment by the council. A study was commissioned in 2012 by the Mineral Resources Department to investigate the feasibility of shale gas exploration in the environmentally-sensitive Karoo.The Treasure Karoo Action Group's Jonathan Deal says the assessment has debunked claims by corporates that fracking will create hundreds of thousands of jobs.He adds the declining cost of renewable energy has hampered fracking dreams. It s now acknowledged internationally that rand for rand, dollar for dollar, renewable energy is creating more sustainable jobs, hands down, over fossil fuels. The CSIR report indicates while there are economic opportunities there is also the risk of a 'boom and bust' that accompanies extractive industries.(Edited by Neo Koza)
