Two young men died, apparently after pushing themselves too hard on a run. JOHANNESBURG Two men in Zimbabwe have reportedly died during a controversial army recruitment exercise. This comes with criticism from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) saying the recruitment of more soldiers is irrational as the government is already struggling to pay civil servants.The state-run Manica Post is reporting that around 6,000 people had turned out to compete for just 350 army places. Two of the young men died, apparently after pushing themselves too hard on a run. This selection last Thursday was for soldiers in the eastern Manicaland province, though the exercise is understood to be underway countrywide, The MDC slammed the recruitment of new soldiers when it was first reported last week, saying the civil service is already bloated. The central bank is due to issue new banknotes next week, and this will fuel speculation they are not just intended as a reward for exporters, as the authorities have tried to claim.
