The National Director of Public Prosecutions has asked investigators to accelerate their probe. JOHANNESBURG The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it is not in the interests of the country for the investigation into the South African Revenue Service (Sars) covert unit to continue in perpetuity. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) has asked investigators to accelerate their probe. The NPA says reports that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the Sars covert unit could be charge by Christmas are entirely without merit. However, it says the investigation is at an advanced stage and NPA head Shaun Abrahams has asked investigators to accelerate the probe. The NPA insists that a decision in respect of this matter will only be made once the investigation has been concluded. Meanwhile, a deadline for the president to make a decision on whether to institute an inquiry into Abrahams fitness to hold office passed at 4pm yesterday with the Presidency saying it never received a letter from civil society organisations asking for the NDPP to be suspended.
