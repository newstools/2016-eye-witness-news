The EFF leader says white people must return the land to its rightful owners. JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says white people must return the land to its rightful owners, adding that he won t slaughter them like they did to blacks, at least for now.Malema was addressing supporters outside the Newcastle Magistrates Courts, where he appeared on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act, by urging his supporters to invade unoccupied land.His case was postponed to next month, with his lawyers saying they will approach the High Court to challenge the Act. The white man has been too comfortable for too long. Malema, undeterred, says his party is on a mission to disturb the white man s peace, saying they found peaceful Africans and killed them like animals. We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now. He has sent out this warning: But white minority be warned, we will take our land no matter what. Malema made remarks that members should occupy unoccupied land earlier this year while addressing supporters in KwaZulu-Natal during the 61st anniversary of the Freedom Charter.The National Prosecuting Authority says by invading land, Malema contravened section 18(2) b of the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956.While EFF leaders have criticised the NPA for using an apartheid law against Malema, supporters gathered outside court say they will be with him every step of the way.He will appear in the Newcastle Magistrates Court again on 5 May.His case has been postponed to 7 December.Meanwhile, the EFF is maintaining its call for land occupation despite the charges and has called for the entire party to be charged, not just Malema.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
