Popo Molefe says some of Prasa&#8217;s irregular spending is the result of investigations recommended by the Public Protector. JOHANNESBURG Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) chairperson Popo Molefe says the organisation is caught between a rock and a hard place following the Auditor General s report that it spent R13.9 billion irregularly. Auditor General Kimi Makwetu presented his annual report on national and provincial audit outcomes in Parliament on Wednesday. Issues pertaining to goods and services being bought but not used is a combination of things that contribute towards fruitless and wasteful expenditure. We think this is long hanging fruit; it's issues of discipline that can be prevented or avoided. The report covers 484 auditees, which include 169 national and provincial departments, and 315 public entities.Of those entities includes Prasa.Molefe says that some of the parastatal s irregular spending is the result of investigations recommended by the Public Protector with regards to past irregularities and incompetence.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
