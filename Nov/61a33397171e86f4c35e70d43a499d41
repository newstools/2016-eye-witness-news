It&#8217;s been announced there&#8217;ll be a recommendation for a 0% increase for a number of offices, including that of the President. JOHANNESBURG The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it supports a moratorium on salary increases for political office bearers, but warns it must not spill over into lowly public servant wage negotiations.The Independent Commission on the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers has announced it will be recommending a 0% increase for a number of offices, including that of the President.Cosatu s Sizwe Pamla says they back the call, urging government to use the opportunity to reduce the size of national and provincial governments as well as the number of Members of Parliament . While we welcome this decision, we want to caution government not to use this as a prelude to freeze the moderate salaries of public servants in 2018 when we open these negotiations. We know that these people are at the coalface of public service delivery. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
