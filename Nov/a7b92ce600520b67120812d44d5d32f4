RAJKOT, INDIA England picked up the wickets of India captain Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane on the fourth morning of the opening test as the hosts went to lunch on 411 for six on Saturday, still 126 runs behind the visitor s mammoth first innings of 537.All-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha were both unbeaten on 29 at the break.After resuming on 319-4, Kohli and Rahane appeared untroubled, picking up singles and doubles with the occasional boundaries to eat into England s total.But Rahane missed a straight delivery while trying to play across the line to left-arm spinner Zafar Ansari and was bowled for 13, ending their promising 30-run partnership just as it looked set to flourish.Kohli, India s best batsman, looked in fine touch and struck some crisp boundaries in his knock of 40 before the right-hander s back leg hit the stumps and dislodged a bail while trying to pull a delivery from leg-spinner Adil Rashid.Kohli stood at the wicket in disbelief before trudging off with his team at 361 for six.Ashwin and Saha survived some nervous moments and added 50 for their unbroken seventh wicket stand to calm India s nerves.Saha saw an edge off all-rounder Ben Stokes go between wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and Alastair Cook at slip.England also lost a decision review for an lbw appeal against Ashwin with replays showing the ball had just hit his bat and not the pad.
