Njongonkulu Ndungane called Shaun Abrahams&#8217;s decision to draw up and then drop fraud charges against Minister Gordhan &#8216;irrational&#8217;. JOHANNESBURG Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Njongonkulu Ndungane has also added his voice to calls for the removal of the National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams, saying his dismissal would be a step in the right direction in holding leaders accountable. Ndungane has called Abrahams s decision irrational, saying it will negatively affect the economy. He says the country is facing a crisis. I am a very hopeful person. We have handled very difficult situations, and the African National Congress (ANC) is broad and there are so many good people within the ANC. At the same time, former Constitutional Court Justice Zak Yacoob says Shaun Abrahams is not worthy of being the National Director of Public Prosecutions.Yacoob says it must have been clear to him that the case wouldn't hold up in court. The interesting thing is why he withdrew the charges. He withdrew because he came to the conclusion that there was no way in which intention could be established.
