JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN - Retail website Groupon will close at midnight due to what has been called an unsustainable business model. Customers with vouchers have been assured that they will be refunded. The site has been running for six years and was enjoyed by many looking for a good deal. However, reports say the bargain website has been taking strain globally, recording a net loss of $35.8 million at the end of September. Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck also says customer service was a problem. Customer service started declining because they were just too busy. There were thousands of customer complaints that they couldn t resolve and that was probably the beginning of the end. Goldstuck says the writing was on the wall for the company globally. Most people who used it for the discounts keep coming back for the discounts. They are not going to start paying the price at retailers when they think they can get the discount on the same products from other retailers. It s like a treadmill that Groupon finds themselves on to have to bring new retailers on board.
