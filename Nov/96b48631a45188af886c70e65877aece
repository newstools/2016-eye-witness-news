Minister Zwane called for the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the termination of financial services to the Gupta family's Oakbay Investments. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants President Jacob Zuma to provide more details around a reprimand he gave Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.In response to a written parliamentary question, Zuma says he reprimanded Zwane for calling for the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the termination of financial services to the Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments.The DA s Shadow Minister of Finance David Maynier says President Zuma s response to a parliamentary question relating to action taken against Minister Zwane constitutes a non-response. In September, the Mineral Resources Minister issued a statement on behalf of a task team established to consider the implications of the decisions of certain banks and audit firms to close down the accounts and withdraw audit services from Gupta firm, Oakbay Investments. The Presidency later said Zwane acted in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the task team or Cabinet.Maynier says Zuma s response that he reprimanded the minister needs to be clarified. I m going to submit a further parliamentary question to President Jacob Zuma probing all the particulars of what amounts to a secret reprimand of the minister for his role in calling for a judicial commission of inquiry. He says Zwane s letter of reprimand should have been tabled in Parliament.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
