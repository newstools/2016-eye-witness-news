The SACP leader has lashed out at the Gupta family, accusing them of undermining SA's hard-won democracy. JOHANNESBURG - South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande has called on South Africans to take a strong stand against what he calls the monopolisation and Guptarisation of the country.Nzimande was speaking at the SACP s annual Red October Campaign in Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg, on Sunday.His comments follow the release of the Public Protector's State of Capture report last week.Nzimande has lashed out at the Gupta family, accusing them of undermining South Africa s hard-won democracy. The Guptas are not our answer to monopoly capital. The answer to monopoly capital is a stronger working class in this country. He says the country is in crisis and the toxic role of the Gupta family must be stopped.Nzimande adds the party has had enough of the abuse of state organs, adding that the family s alleged influence over the state is problematic. We as the SACP have also raised the issues of what we call the parasitic bourgeoisie that is seeking to cut through the state and the very problematic role being played by the Gupta family.
