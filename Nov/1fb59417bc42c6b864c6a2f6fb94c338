President Zuma was given until 4pm today to respond to a letter from two civil society organisations to suspend NPA head Shaun Abrahams. JOHANNESBURG As National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams waits to hear how the president will respond to an ultimatum to suspend him, the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) has called on investigators to finish the probe into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The president was given until 4pm today to respond to a letter from Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation to suspend Abrahams and institute an inquiry into his fitness to hold office. The Presidency has not yet indicated how it will respond to the letter from the civil society organisations. It is likely that if the Presidency does not respond favourably, Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundations will turn to the courts to try and get Abrahams removed.At the same time, the NPA head has issued a statement rubbishing reports that Minister Gordhan will be criminally charged again before Christmas. #NPA statement on #Gordhan charges pic.twitter.com/7njCKunr2nThe prosecuting authority says that investigations into the South African Revenue Service's covert unit are currently underway and are believed to be at an advanced stage. It adds that a decision in respect of this matter will only be made once the investigation has been concluded.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
