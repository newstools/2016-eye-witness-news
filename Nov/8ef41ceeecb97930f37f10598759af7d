She said she still had trouble accepting his death. I am convinced there will never be another like Fidel. We need him, he had vision, she said.Cuba s allies and foes around the world have marked Castro s death with a mix of tributes and condemnation.US President Barack Obama, who reversed more than five decades of US hostility toward Cuba and re-established diplomatic ties last year, called Castro a singular figure and said the United States would extend a hand of friendship to Cuba.But Obama s elected successor, Donald Trump, who has threatened to reverse Obama s opening to Cuba, issued a blunt statement calling Castro a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. It is unclear whether Trump, who takes office on 20 January, will continue efforts to normalise relations with Cuba or fulfil a campaign promise to close the US embassy in Havana once again.Additional information by Reuters(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
