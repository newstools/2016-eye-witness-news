You may initially be shocked by what you see, but this is a message you should pay attention to. JOHANNESBURG - In the Eyewitness News newsroom we are very used to people receiving packages. Sometimes it s a bunch of flowers or chocolates, or even the results of an online shopping spree, but on Tuesday it was something unexpected - and for some, unnecessary.Two boxes were delivered by an organisation which not only wanted to get a reaction from us, but also had an important message to spread.When we opened the packages we were shocked to see underwear, cloths and newspapers with what appeared to be blood stains. I was not ready for this. To be honest, nobody was.But as much as we may have wanted to look away from the items (which were only soaked with red paint), the fact is that this is the unfortunate reality for many young girls in South Africa.Because of their socio-economic circumstances, they can simply not afford sanitary pads, and are each month forced to use all sorts of items as alternatives to sanitary pads, placing their health and dignity at risk.Mimi, the only black- owned South African sanitary pad company, sent out these packages to urge corporates to step in and make donations towards its initiative to distribute these items during its 16 days of activism campaign.The company says it wants to highlights the importance of young girls having a source of sanitary pads, saying that the absence of such an important resource could lead to exploitation. Some girls will go as far as to exchange sex for money or pads in order to avoid the public humiliation that can come with their menstrual cycle, says Mimi CEO Ramona Kasavan. We can t address poverty in its entirety but we can address one of the root causes of the blesser phenomenon - girls being ostracised and excluded due to their periods.
