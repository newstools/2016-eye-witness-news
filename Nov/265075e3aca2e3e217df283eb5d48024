A special motion on the emancipation &amp; empowerment of young women struggled to get underway in Parliament. CAPE TOWN - In Parliament today, a special motion on the emancipation and empowerment of young women struggled to get underway due to numerous interruptions predominantly from Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Members of Parliament (MPs).The African National Congress (ANC)'s Zephroma Dlamini-Dubazana this afternoon highlighted progress in connection with women's rights and opportunities. I ve said to the young women, you could be at University of Cape Town, Wits University, University of KwaZulu-Natal or at home, anywhere you are, the ANC is there for you. The ANC is looking after you and has given you opportunities, make us of them. But she was continuously interrupted by MPs, like the EFF's Leigh-Ann Mathys. The speaker is deliberately misleading the House. She can never say that the ANC has given water to everybody. Lies. Can she withdraw that statement? (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
