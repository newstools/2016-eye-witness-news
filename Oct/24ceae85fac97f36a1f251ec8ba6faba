Mthembu is reportedly proposing the ANCs national executive should resign for failing Pravin Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Jackson Mthembu is reportedly proposing that the party's national executive should resign for failing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Mthembu has told the City Press he's deeply hurt to witness the ANC-government using instruments of state to pursue its own minister. The announcement by the NPA that Gordhan is facing fraud charges over an early pension payout sent shockwaves through the country and the markets. The chief whip has publicly backed the finance minister in the matter describing him as an honest person. Mthembu has reportedly accused the ANC of reducing the governing party to something that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, amid swirling claims that the NPA's decision to charge Gordhan and two formers Sars executives, is part of a political plot against the finance minister. The ANC chief whip says Gordhan is being pursued in a manner that's both anti-democracy and anti-ANC and adds he'll oppose this along with others. Several of the ANC's senior members including Ahmed Kathrada have pledged their support for the finance minister, with business leaders and civil society doing the same, while the ANC Women's League has said Gordhan must have his day in court. Mthembu has also warned that unless the ruling party does things differently it will not be in power after the 2019 general election. NPA head Shaun Abrahams has dismissed claims that Gordhan's prosecution is politically motivated.
