Dlamini-Zuma says South Africans shouldn't fear being swamped by people from other countries. JOHANNESBURG - African Union Commission Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says people should be able to move freely around the continent and South Africans shouldn't fear being swamped by people from other countries. She was speaking at a dinner held for the South African National Editors Forum last night. Dlamini-Zuma says for Africa's economy to grow, the current system of visas and borders needs to change. &quot;Of course goods must travel freely, but people must also travel freely&quot; And she says South African's shouldn't be afraid of this. &quot;And contrary to belief here that if you open up your borders you will be swamped. Countries that have big economies have not seen that.&quot; She also says that Africa hasn't managed to find ways to allow most people access to higher education.
