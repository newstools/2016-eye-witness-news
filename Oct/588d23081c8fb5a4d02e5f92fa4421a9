National Treasury says it has no intention of conducting the Oakbay case in the court of public opinion. JOHANNESBURG - National Treasury says it's peculiar that Oakbay Investments is making public statements about Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's affidavit, saying the matter should be dealt with in court. This week the Gupta familys attorney said his clients were ready to go to court to over R6.8 billion worth of suspicious transactions after Gordhan refused to drop his legal action against them. Gordhan is seeking an application for a declaratory order showing he's not able to force the banks to re-open their accounts with the Guptas. National Treasury says it has no intention of conducting the Oakbay case in the court of public opinion and has asked the lawyers representing the Guptas company to respect the legal process. The affidavit by Gordhan doesnt make any interpretations on the financial intelligent report, which flags several transactions as suspicious, but rather puts the material facts before the court. Treasury has stated that the finance minister has presented his case under oath in an appropriate forum and its incumbent on the Oakbay respondent to do the same. However, the Gupta family lawyers insist they can prove all these transactions are legal. To read the court papers filed by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, click here.
