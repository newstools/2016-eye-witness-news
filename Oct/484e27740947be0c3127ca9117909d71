The Gupta family lawyer says he has extensive knowledge on the Optimum deal. JOHANNESBURG - The lawyer representing the Gupta family says hell be surprised if there are any adverse consequences for the former Oakbay CEO Nazeem Howaand his dealing in the Optimum Coal mine purchase. The Sunday Times reported that Howa could still find himself in some trouble after allegedly being involved in corruption with regards to the purchase of Optimum Coal. Howa resigned recently as Oakbays CEO, citing health issues. Attorney Gert van der Merwe says he has extensive knowledge on the Optimum deal. Ive also indicated that I had a fair amount of knowledge of how the Optimum deal went through and how it was structured. So Ill be surprised if theres any consequences that follows him whatsoever. Shortly after his resignation last week, Howa said the company would be recognised as the type that South Africa needs in time - one that is innovative, creates jobs, pays tax and abides by the law. In court papers filed by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, it shows that Howa asked the minister to intervene in the Gupta family's dispute with four major banks that closed their accounts. Howas resignation came just days after a bombshell affidavitby Gordhan revealed that nearly R7 billion worth of financial transactions made by companies aligned to the Gupta family were suspicious. The family has come under pressure due to allegations that they influenced President Jacob Zuma's Cabinet appointments, details which have apparently been outlined in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's state capture report. The Guptas and Zumas son Duduzane resigned from Oakbay in April after four major banks cut ties with the family, closing their accounts.
