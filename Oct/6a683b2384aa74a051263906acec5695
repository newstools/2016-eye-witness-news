An 11-year-old boy was reportedly among the three people killed over the weekend. CAPE TOWN - An Uitsig community leader says three people, including an 11-year-old boy, have been killed by stray bullets from suspected gang shootouts over the weekend. David Van Wyk says the child was playing on a field with friends when he was struck by a bullet yesterday afternoon. Van Wyk says a lack of police visibility remains a cause for concern. Our children are dying on the streets. Recently, a young boy was killed with a shotgun. My concern is were moving into the festive season and the community is living in fear.
