WATCH: TUT management to protesting students: No fee increase for 2017 Van Steden says he does not understand why the Soshanguve site, out of the institutions 17 other sites, is still protesting. Why there is a group on the Soshanguve campus [still protesting]? We will have to investigate so to see why it is continuing there and not elsewhere in this university. He says his institution supports the Fees Must Fall movement, but only if their demands are feasible. We are actually supporting the idea for free education if its feasible at all. Some classes and lectures are continuing under a heavy police and campus security presence.
