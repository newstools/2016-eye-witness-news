MUMBAI - England's Ben Stokes could mature into one of thegreatest ever all-rounders, coach Trevor Bayliss said after the 25-year-old'smatch-winning performance in the opening test against Bangladesh.Stokes was man-of-the-match in England's thrilling 22-runvictory in Chittagong, taking six wickets, including two in three balls to sealvictory on the final day.He also scored a vital 85 with the bat in the second inningsafter England's top order had collapsed on day three.&quot;He could be right up there with some of the all-timebest all-rounders,&quot; Bayliss told reporters in Dhaka ahead of the secondtest starting Friday.&quot;He's young into his career and that's going to beeasier to judge the longer he goes. Only time will tell.&quot;But the strides he's made on the subcontinent playingspin have been top class.&quot;England captain Alastair Cook said after Chittagong thatStokes brought 'X factor' to the side and put the all-rounder's improvementdown to his work playing spin.Bayliss agreed.&quot;It wasn't all that long ago we were wondering how hemight go on spin-friendly wickets, but he's a guy that works extremely hard inthe nets,&quot; the 53-year-old Australian said. &quot;It's his defence to spinthat has improved out of sight.&quot;We know that if he gets a bad ball he can hit anythingover the fence, but you've got to be there to get that loose ball. In the pasthe probably hasn't had a lot of footwork, has played from the crease and backedhis eye and his hands.&quot;But as we've seen on this tour, in the one-dayers andthis test, he's defended really well off the front foot, got right out andsmothered the ball before it had a chance to spin and jump past the outsideedge.&quot;Leg-spinner Adil Rashid had a more modest performance inChittagong, managing three wickets on a spin-friendly surface, but Baylissurged patience with the four-test bowler ahead of a five-match test series inIndia next month.&quot;Look, it's only been the very, very best leg-spinnerswho have got the control and consistency and ability to take wickets,&quot;said Bayliss of the 28-year-old.&quot;I think Rash is still on a journey there and he'sstill improving. He's getting more and more confident.&quot;I expect that once upon a time thespinners weren't thought of as getting to their peak until their earlythirties, so he's still got a bit to learn yet. But I think he's on the righttrack.&quot;
