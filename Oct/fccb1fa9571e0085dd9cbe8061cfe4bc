Over the past few months, a number of agencies have expressed concerns about growth. CAPE TOWN - Pre sident Jacob Zuma says government values the work done by rating agencies as it gives insight into assessing theeconomy. He was answering questions inthe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) this afternoon. Over the past few months a number of agencies have expressed concerns about growth, with another downgrade possible. Zuma says ratings agencies are vital. Since most countries depend on international investors and access to international capital markets, good credit ratings are very important. At the same time, President Zuma says Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Brics) are looking at rating themselves as they have abetter understanding oftheir own economies. However, he says while Europefaces problems,too much attention is given to developing nations when discussing theirissues andthesecountries are better placed to rate themselves. The views of economists in the world are not exactly the same. There may be people who have a particular school of economic thinking who are part of rating agencies and there may be other people who think differently. He says Brics countrieswant toevaluate themselves. They therefore think they need a rating agency that will be moving from the understanding and the philosophy of these countries as to how the economy should be.
