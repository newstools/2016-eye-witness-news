Shaun Abrahams charged Pravin Gordhan with fraud earlier this month. JOHANNESBURG - Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer general&nbsp;Mathews Phosa&nbsp;says he&rsquo;ll be writing to the General Council of the Bar today to ask for an investigation&nbsp;into National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams after he charged the finance minister with fraud. Pravin Gordhan&nbsp;was charged earlier this month for approving the early retirement of Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay almost six years ago in a move&nbsp;that&rsquo;s&nbsp;been highly criticised by some quarters. Over the weekend, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa offered his political support to Gordhan while the Finance Minister filed a court application about the Gupta family&rsquo;s suspicious transactions amounting to R6.8 billion. Phosa, a long-time member of the ANC, has also&nbsp;written to the president asking that&nbsp;Abrahams be investigated. He says&nbsp;the NPA cannot be a lapdog of the presidency and the head should be appointed by Parliament and not the president to remain independent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write a letter this afternoon to the General Council of the Bar&nbsp;to investigate. &nbsp;I agree with comrade Cyril [Ramaphosa], he did a good thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a little late but it&rsquo;s appreciated. Pravin Gordhan must be left to do the business of the people including to root out corruption without fear or favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; The new Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, is due to receive Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s report into state capture that is believed to focus on the relationship between the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma. At the same time, it&rsquo;s now emerged that Oakbay Resources is investigating five of 72 transactions reported to authorities as suspicious. The company is controlled by businessmen close to President Zuma.
