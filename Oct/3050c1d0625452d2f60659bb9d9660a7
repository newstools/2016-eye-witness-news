JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says her department will be keeping a close eye on all the provinces as matrics resume their final exams tomorrow. The 2016 national senior certificate examinations kicked off last week. This year's exams have been described as the biggest yet in South African history, with 9,000 more learners enrolled to write, compared with 2015. Motshekga's spokesperson, Troy Martens, says they are paying particular attention to Vuwani, where more than 20 schools were burned down during a protest earlier this year. &quot;We're pleased with what's going on, the exams so fare are running smoothly, even considering measures to make sure things are done well in that area.&quot; Grade 12s will start their second week with paper two of maths and maths literacy.
