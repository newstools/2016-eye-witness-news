Officer Lesiba Ramaru testified that Patel hid the clothes he wore on the day of his wifes murder. JOHANNESBURG Investigating officers have been called to the stand in the Polokwane High Court to give evidence in the trial of murder accused Rameez Patel. Patel is charged with killing his wife Fatima last year but he claims that she was killed by burglars. She was bludgeoned and strangled to death. The trial has entered its second week with several witnesses being called by the State to testify. Investigating officer Lesiba Ramaru says Rameez Patel hid the clothes he wore on the day of the murder. He says he questioned Patel on where his clothes were after arriving at the scene, as there was no blood on what he was wearing. Patel responded that he had taken a shower after holding his wifes bloody body. Earlier, a domestic worker employed by the couples neighbour testified that she had seen a man wearing a blue tracksuit walking up and down the corridor of the complex before she heard a gunshot. The tracksuit was later found at another house, and not at the murder scene. The State has argued that chemicals were used when washing Patels clothes. The trial continues.
