UCT says alternative tuition methods will remain in place for as long as protests continue on campus. CAPE TOWN - The University of Cape Town (UCT) says alternative tuition methods will remain in place for as long as disruptive protests continue on campus. Fresh protests broke out at the Chancellor Oppenheimer Library on the institution's upper campus yesterday. The university's Elijah Moholola says: "Teaching and learning is taking place through various approaches, which includes blended learning that relies heavily on digital materials. Each faculty is developing its own approach to teaching." At the same time, a UCT lecturer says he and colleagues have resorted to secret meetings as they try to complete the academic year. The lecturer, who doesn't want to be named, says it's not ideal - but it seems to be working. "People are doing many things online and meeting in secret places to basically conduct the business of finishing the year. It works fairly well, but it's an absolute crisis in the college of music because we have face-to-face teaching."
