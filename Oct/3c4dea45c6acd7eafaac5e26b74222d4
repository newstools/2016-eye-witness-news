Mandisa Mlambo was tied up on Tuesday night by burglars, who also made off with her child. JOHANNESBURG - The mother of a 14-month-old baby boy who was snatched from her home in Protea Glen in Soweto says she does not understand why her son was kidnapped. Mandisa Mlambo was tied up on Tuesday night by burglars who also made off with the child and valuables. She and her baby's nanny were tied up with a rope for hours in her home, before they managed to free themselves and looked for help around 5am on Wednesday morning. Mlambo explains her ordeal. &quot;The other one had a fire arm, while the other had a knife. He put the knife on my neck and said if I continue making noise he will kill me.&quot; Police have obtained and released pictures of one of the suspects withdrawing money from a nearby ATM with the hope of getting some help from the community in nabbing them. In the meantime, Mlambo is surrounded by family and neighbours to try help her through her trauma and stress.
