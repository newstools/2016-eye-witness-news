Lesufi revealed that the Gauteng Education Department is funding Dlaminiâ€™s postgraduate studies. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says his department will have to review the financial support it's giving to Wits student leader Mcebo Dlamini after he was arrested for his involvement in # FeesMustFall protests. Lesufi revealed this week that the Gauteng Education Department is funding Dlamini's postgraduate studies at Wits. Dlamini was arrested on Sunday and faces five charges including malicious damage to property, assault and theft. The Johannesburg Magistrates Court is expected to make a decision today on whether or not to grant the student leader bail. Lesufi says his department won't tolerate disruptions to education and is therefore forced to review Dlamini's scholarship. "I don't agree that we can fund somebody who wants to disrupt education. It's a costly amount of money. When he applied we had no idea these things would happen and now we have no choice but to review it."
