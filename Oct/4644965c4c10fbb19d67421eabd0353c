Former SABC board members &amp; executives will be among the witnesses called when the inquiry gets underway. CAPE TOWN - Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board members and executives, who were suspended or sacked will be among the witnesses called when Parliament's inquiry into the fitness of its board gets underway.The inquiry has been postponed again because Parliament's Communications Committee wants to follow due process and give the remaining four board members time to prepare and consult lawyers.The further postponement of the hearing was announced this afternoon by Communications committee chair Humphrey Maxegwana.&quot;We want the process to be as fair as possible, so that those who will be questioned have time to prepare and consult their legal representatives.&quot;Maxegwana says notices of the inquiry will be served on the board members by 28 October, and that a date for the inquiry will then be set.Committee whip, African National Congress MP Lerumo Kalako says a number of witnesses want to come forward.&quot;People who were on the board executives who were suspended, dismissed, might want to come, so we don't want to close the process.&quot;The inquiry was initially set down to begin today and end on Friday.Late yesterday, it was postponed until next week.Maxegwana says he hopes to give an update this Friday on when it will get underway.
