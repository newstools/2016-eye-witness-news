Chief Justice Mogoeng says when judiciaries are strong, businesses will develop confidence in Africa. JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says strong judiciaries support stable governments, which leads to greater economic investment. He was speaking at the International Association of Refugee Law Judges Conference in Pretoria yesterday. Delegates at the conference discussed access to justice for refugees, protection of refugees and other immigration related issues. Mogoeng says when judiciaries are strong, businesses will develop confidence in the security of their investments on the African continent. &quot;Assure that if anybody were to threaten, to expropriate what belongs to them in return for nothing independent courts could be resorted to secure what belongs to them. The rule of law exists.&quot; He says when investment increases, so do opportunities which leads to a decrease in economic migrants in Africa. Mogoeng urged delegates to discuss ways of strengthening their respective judiciaries.
