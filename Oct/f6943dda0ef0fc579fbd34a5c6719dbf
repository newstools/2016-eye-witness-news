Anofficer, a paramedic anda former South African Revenue Service official were arrested earlier this week for colluding with suspected illegal cigarette smugglers. Three other officers were also arrestedonthe same charges. The Hawks say the trade of illegal cigarettes needs more attention, particularly in places near borders such as Musina. Limpopo spokesperson Matimba Maluleke says it is concerning that corrupt officials are using police and EMS vehicles to move contraband over the borders. It is a crisis as we still have government employees using state resources for corrupt activities. We are busy taking them out one by one. Maluleke says the purge of corrupt officials from the South African Police Service will continue with a zero-tolerance approach to crime, even in the police force. The three officers have been released on bail of R2,000 and will appear at the Musina Magistrates Court on 29 November.
