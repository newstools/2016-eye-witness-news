Another Soweto Derby and another dull stalemate in front of a buzzing capacity crowd at the FNB Stadium. JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs' clash may have taken the back seat in the media, earlier in the week, with Mamelodi Sundowns hogging the headlines for their African heroics, but by Friday, attention had turned to them and expectations of a fiery match were high. There would be no fire coming from either side as they both struggled to put the ball in the back of the net. It wasn't in any way, by lack of effort that the score ended on 0-0 but the tens of thousands of fans were hoping that their favourite teams would deliver on the hype. Some of the best efforts in the game came from Sibusiso Khumalo, Thabo Matlaba, Mpho Makola, Michee Katsaviro and Siphiwe Tshabalala, who came on in the second half and breathed life into the match. Tshabalala had one of the best chances of the game, his shot well saved by Brighton Mhlongo, while his teammate Henrick Ekstein could've put Chiefs ahead in the first half after he struck a great volley that just went over the bar. Pirates' Gift Motupa was another one with a golden chance, but he too skied his effort, after being nicely supplied by Tendai Ndoro. Both Steve Komphela and Muhsin Ertugral seemed pleased with their teams' efforts, despite having to share the spoils.
