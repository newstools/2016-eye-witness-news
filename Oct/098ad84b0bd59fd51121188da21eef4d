The scientific committee has recommended a global increase of 3,000 tons for the 2018-2020 fishing seasons. CAPE TOWN &ndash; Government&rsquo;s Fisheries Department has welcomed the increase in the country's allocation to catch&nbsp;Southern Bluefin Tuna. The Commission for Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna made the announcement during its recent meeting&nbsp;in Taiwan. The organisation&rsquo;s scientific committee has recommended a global increase of 3,000 tons for the 2018 to 2020 fishing seasons. The department says the expansion will lead to job creation in the fishing industry. The department&rsquo;s Bomikazi Molapo says&nbsp;South Africa&rsquo;s&nbsp;hike in fishing allocations&nbsp;forms part of the commission's planned&nbsp;increases. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve&nbsp;received an&nbsp;increased from 150 tons to 450 tons as a country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The World Wide Fund for Nature's Chris Kastern says these new allocations could affect the&nbsp;recovery of the stock. &ldquo;This species itself is slow growing, it&rsquo;s late maturing and it&rsquo;s long lived, so this makes it susceptible to overfishing which is a key concern.&rdquo; The Southern Bluefin Tuna is listed&nbsp;on the&nbsp;WWF's 'Red-list' and is noted as &lsquo;critically endangered&rsquo; by the IUCN, primarily due to low stock levels and concerns about illegal, unreported &amp; unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.
