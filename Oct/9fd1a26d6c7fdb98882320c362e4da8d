The DA wants government to ensure universities that have been closed for a month, will be opened. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants government to ensure universities that have been closed for a month, will be opened and will be properly funded. The party and its student wing Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (DASO) are holding a picket outside the gates of Parliament in a protest calling for a resolution to the current crisis in higher education. This is the second march to Parliamentary today, with a third by Fees Must Fall protesters, on the way. DASO IS HERE.

DASO leader Yusuf Cassim says violence is not a solution to the current impasse. &quot;Universities have been shut down for months now and the argument that is made by the Fees Must Fall movement is that 'if we shut down universities and bring them to a stand still, the African National Congress government is going to do something and they have not.'&quot; Earlier, a number of academics, led by University of Cape Town vice-chancellor Max Price held a picket outside Parliament calling for more university funding. &quot;Our universities are what will ensure our countrys future.&quot; - @MmusiMaimane #FundOurUniversities pic.twitter.com/0RXaQ6mcby&mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) October 26, 2016 &quot;Our universities are what will ensure our countrys future.&quot; - @MmusiMaimane #FundOurUniversities pic.twitter.com/0RXaQ6mcby A memorandum was handed over to an official from the Higher Education department.
