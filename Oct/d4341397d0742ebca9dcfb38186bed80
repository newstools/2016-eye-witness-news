Finance Minister Gordhan said that if South Africans work together, economic recovery will be more rapid. JOHANNESBURG - The mid-term budget speech by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has been seen as once again instilling a sense of hope for South Africa's economy saying it's in difficulty but not declining. Gordhan delivered his medium-term budget speech in Parliament yesterday saying the plan is to cut expenditure by R10 billion in 2017 and add R13 billion in revenue. He maintains if South Africans work together and collectively make the right choices economic recovery will be more rapid. During his budget speech Gordhan made a point of highlighting the need for leadership and teamwork to tackle challenges facing the economy. &quot;Either we work as a South African pack or we work as a divided pack. What we seek, and more, can be done if we collectively make the right choices&quot; Economist Lesiba Mothatha says Gordhan delivered a balanced budget addressing all major issues. &quot;The minister seemingly has taken heart from the global markets publication that suggests that the national treasury is the best sovereign debt management operation and issuer in Southern Africa.&quot; At the same time Gordhan faces fraud charges, although this didn't deter him or his positive attitude. Many political and business leaders have pledged their support for him in court next week. LISTEN: 'Pravin Gordan filled a leadership vacuum. His speech was presidential'
