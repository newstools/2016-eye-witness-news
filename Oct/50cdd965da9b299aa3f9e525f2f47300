The university says it has now decided to beef up security on campus following the incident. CAPE TOWN - Police are investigating a case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm after two security guards were attacked at the University of Cape Town(UCT). The guards were injured during clashes with demonstrating students this week. A rock was dropped on the head of one of the men from the upper story of the Steve Biko Students' Union building. University management says he escaped serious injury thanks to the protective headgear he was wearing at the time. The other guard has since been discharged from hospital. The institution says it has now decided to beef up security on campus. Meanwhile, five UCT students have been barred from participating in campus demonstrations. This was among the conditions of a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling handed down yesterday. The group had appealed an initial High Court ruling. The students had erected a shack on campus earlier this year to highlight the institution's housing problem. UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola says: The University of Cape Town notes and respects the ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal. In terms of the judgment itself, five appellants are interdicted from erecting unauthorised structures on any of the UCT campuses.
