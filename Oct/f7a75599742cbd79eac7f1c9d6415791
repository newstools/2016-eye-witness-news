Obviously, very thankful for the invitation, happy to be part of this cause.&quot;It's been around for 24 years and it's my first attendance. Thrilled to be part of it.&quot;Sharapova, whose ban was cut from two years to 15 months by the Court of Arbitration last week, can return to competition in April, one month before the French Open.The 29-year-old, who teamed up with John McEnroe to beat Navratilova and Andy Roddick in her second match, acknowledged that the journey back would be a tough one.&quot;Yeah, I will look to play maybe a couple of exhibition events leading up to my first tournament in April,&quot; she added.&quot;I don't know what those will be, but I think that's one of the things that will be really important because match play, you can never really replicate it. You can practise as much as you want but there's nothing really like it.&quot;
