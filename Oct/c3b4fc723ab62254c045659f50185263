Pravin Gordhan says SA needs to focus on increasing confidence as he prepares for mid-term budget. JOHANNESBURG &ndash; Finance&nbsp;Minister Pravin Gordhan&nbsp;says his relations with&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma&nbsp;are &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that he is preparing to deliver his medium-term budget policy statement in Parliament next week. Gordhan addressed a trade union conference in Boksburg this afternoon. He is facing fraud charges in court next month, after the&nbsp;National Prosecuting Authority&nbsp;(NPA) said last week, that he illegally authorised the early retirement of former South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Ivan Pillay. The NPA has come under heavy criticism for the move. Minister Gordhan did not want to be drawn on his relationship with the president. &ldquo;He is my president, so I have to have good relations with him. Everything is fine, we are busy preparing for what we call &lsquo;our mini budget&rsquo;.&rdquo; The state capture report, compiled by&nbsp;former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela,&nbsp;allegedly contains explosive details about President Zuma&rsquo;s relationship with the controversial Gupta family who have been accused of influencing Cabinet appointments, including Des van Rooyen&rsquo;s brief appointment as to finance minister last year. But Gordhan says South Africa needs to focus on increasing confidence. &ldquo;Since my appointment in December, we have had our own difficulties in terms of confidence in our own economy, and our ability to survive what everybody calls &lsquo;Nenegate&rsquo; today.&rdquo; The finance minister is working on his medium term budget speech and says there&rsquo;s been some progress despite the economy not growing fast enough.
