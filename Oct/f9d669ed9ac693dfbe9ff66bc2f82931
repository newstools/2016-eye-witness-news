Firms including Anglo American, Barclays Africa Group &amp; Naspers want fraud charges dropped. JOHANNESBURG - Eighty-one CEOs have signed a pledgein support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, sayingthey standagainst politically motivated prosecutions. Gordhan was charged with fraud by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) two weeks ago for approving the early retirement of former Sars commissioner Ivan Pillay six years ago. The ministeris due in court next week. The decision by the NPA has been highly criticised, with several ministers, former ministers, struggle stalwarts and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa publicly rallying behind Gordhan. Firms including Anglo American, Barclays Africa Group and Naspers want fraud charges against Gordhan to be dropped. CEO of Goldman Sachs Colin Coleman says they want to send a strong message. What we believe in is the rule of law. We believe in the justice system and our democratic institutions being protected. What we dont want is arbitrary action. The minister has dismissed the accusations as frivolous and politically motivated. Analysts and supporters of Gordhan, whose first court appearance is scheduled for 2 November, argue that the charges could be a ploy by President Jacob Zuma allies to discredit him. The president has said he is not in conflict with Gordhan and the country's top prosecutor has denied that the charges are politically motivated. Gordhan said last week his relations with Zuma were very good. Additional reporting by Reuters.
