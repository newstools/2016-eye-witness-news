In the past several weeks I've been receiving emails, texts and tags to speak upon this image which has turned into an Internet meme for people to make jokes off. I wish the positive aspect of this image will go viral instead of how it's being portrayed as. I understand it's something I can't control. I can only continue to positively impact the lives of people with my talent and purpose. Everyone Say Hi to my buddy Jake. This was moments in Ghana during my Art workshop with the kids. Each kid received brand new set of crayons, pencil colors, pencils, toys and other wonderful goodies. The expressions on their faces were heartfelt. People often ask me why and how I'm able to continue helping children through my #HomelandGhana mission. The truth is, it's never about me. There are 3 things that comes first before my talent. My faith in God, Purpose in Life and the People who inspire my work. To me, my work has no value without these three. I've experienced first hand the impact just the little act of kindness can make in the lives of the less privileged. The amount of joy and happiness they have in their heart despite their living conditions speaks volume about their inner beauty. Jake was one of the children I taught in Ghana. He was always gentle and quiet.. Ever present in class and was eager to learn everyday. That's what I loved about all the children. Their enthusiasm and high spirit was refreshing and encouraged me to continue helping them. shot by: @therealcarloscort #Africa #Ghana #Positivity #viral #inspiration #homelandseriesghana #share #love #peace #impact #philanthropist #artist #meme #SouthAfrica #Kenya #Nigeria #Ghana #Ethiopia #Uganda #Tanzania A photo posted by SOLOMON ADUFAH (@solomonadufah) on Oct 26, 2016 at 7:02am PDT LETS SUPPORT JAKE: Contribute to his education.
