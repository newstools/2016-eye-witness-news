An NPO is calling on white families to move to the Eastern Cape to start a new society. CAPE TOWN - Questions are being raised about the legality of a proposed so called 'whites only settlement' in the Eastern Cape. A human rights expert says there is technically nothing illegal about a planned whites only settlement, as long as it doesn't get involved in the world of business. It is understood that a company called Die Eden Projek officially registered as a non-profit organisation earlier this year and is calling on white families to move to an area near Willowmore in the Eastern Cape to start a new society. The company took to social media last month, asking for donations of infrastructure to help get the settlement started. Project leader, Jaqui Gradwell, posted an online video last month, saying he's had enough of modern South Africa.  He says, "In the past twenty years, a lot of things happened in this country - farm murders, murders in the city that have been forced on our people by black people." Gradwell subsequently invited white families to pack up their belongings and move to a piece of land that he allegedly bought, to start anew. Wits law professor Cathi Albertyn says there's no legal basis to challenge this. "If you're going to invite people to come and stay for free, as if it was his private house, then yes, I assume he could do that." She however adds as soon as money becomes involved, the situation changes. "As soon as you are going to sell or lease property or allow business opportunities, our law would not allow you to discriminate on the basis of race without justification and I can't think of any, given the history of our country."
