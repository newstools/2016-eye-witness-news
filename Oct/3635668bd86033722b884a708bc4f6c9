The first Test gets underway from 3 November 2016 at the WACCA in Perth. JOHANNESBURG - The uncapped spinning duo of Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj have been called up to the Proteas squad to tour Australia in a three-match test series in November. South Africa and the Aussies are currently in action in a five-match one-day international series, which the South Africans are dominating, leading 4-0, with the last match in Cape Town still to be played on Wednesday. Shamsi impressed in the fourth ODI in Port Elizabeth on Sunday, where he took three wickets for 36 runs, while Maharaj produced a masterclass for his franchise, the Dolphins, in the Sunfoil Series. He took seven wickets against the Warriors, guiding his side to an innings and 70-run victory. Rilee Rossouw, who's also made a major impact for the ODI side in the series against Australia, is another uncapped player called up to the squad as a specialist batsman. Veteran fast bowler Morne Morkel makes a return to the national team after an injury layoff, and he will be joined back in the team by Dean Elgar, who also comes back from injury. Dane Vilas has been penned in as back-up in the wicketkeeper position, which is set to be covered by Quinton de Kock. The only notable exclusion from the squad is that of AB de Villiers, who is still nursing an injury, meaning that Faf du Plessis will captain the side in his absence. The first Test gets underway from 3 November 2016 at the Western Australia Cricket Association Ground in Perth. Proteas test squad to face Australia: Faf du Plessis (captain), Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Stephen Cook, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Dean Elgar, Keshav Maharaj, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Tabraiz Shamsi, Dale Steyn, Dane Vilas
