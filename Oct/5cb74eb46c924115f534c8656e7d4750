The demonstration comes just days ahead of the minister&#8217;s appearance in court on charges of fraud. PRETORIA - A group of about 60 people picketed outside the Sars headquarters in Brooklyn in Pretoria to show their support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The demonstration comes just days ahead of the minister s appearance in court on charges of fraud. Thousands of people are expected to converge on the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Wednesday where Gordhan and former Sars officials Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula are scheduled to make their first appearance. Organiser Peggy Pillay says the case against the trio is frivolous. &quot;Our picketing is about creating a sense of awareness with people who work within Sars that there is support and also we wanted to create an awareness that people in living in South Africa are starting to find their voice and they're starting to say 'enough is enough.'&quot;
