Classes have resumed at Wits despite overnight skirmishes between student protesters and police. JOHANNESBURG - Classes are currently underway at Wits University as per the academic calendar, despite several skirmishes between a group of protesting students and police near the men's residence in Parktown overnight. Management says some students blocked the road from the Matrix to the Old Mutual Sports Hall with rocks and threw a petrol bomb at a police van after pelting it with stones. But Wits says attendance was high at the majority of lectures on Monday. University spokesperson Shirona Patel says: "Only last week you had attendance dwindling on the Monday and Tuesday but by Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - following the violence and clashes on campus - we saw the numbers in classes improve dramatically. This week attendance is at an all-time high again." At the same, the university has confirmed that Arthur Mohamelwa returned to his residence yesterday after making contact with his house committee and warden. Mohamelwa had been missing since Sunday. It's understood he was kidnapped by police and dumped in a Limpopo veld. The student was taken to a clinic for a medical check yesterday and has been offered counselling. Patel says the Dean of Students reached out to Mohamelwa, but he refused to meet with management. "He has made contact with his housemates. The Dean of Students has tried to reach out to him to find out what happen, but he has refused to meet with any member of management. The university has asked him to lay a formal complaint so the matter can be investigated further." Meanwhile, student leader Mcebo Dlamini is expected to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court today on charges of assault, malicious damage to property, theft, public violence and the possession of a dangerous weapon.
