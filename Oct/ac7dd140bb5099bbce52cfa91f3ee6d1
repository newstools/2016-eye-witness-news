Several people have been injured in todayâ€™s clashes, including two journalists. JOHANNESBURG - Police have just opened fire with another round of rubber bullets as Wits University students try and block off traffic to Jorissen and Bertha Streets. Earlier, students pelted stones at private security guards at the Great Hall after trying to force their way in. Police then moved in, firing stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons to disperse them. Students have retaliated by setting a bus on fire.    One journalist has been treated and transported to hospital after an apparent rubber bullet to the face. Protesting Wits university students have now moved to the streets of Braamfontein, blocking the roads and are pelting stones at police vehicles and private vehicles trying to make their way through the streets of Braamfontein. Cars driving from the Nelson Mandela Bridge have been barred from using Bertha Street.   Paramedics are stationed around Wits; some are patrolling in cars. Students say they will not allow the academic activity to continue as they also disrupted classes earlier and emptied libraries. Several people have been injured in today's clashes, including two journalists. Some emergency vehicles have also been seen in Braamfontein as it is believed some students are injured. At the same time, Fees Must Fall leader Busisiwe Seabe has called on students to prepare to reclaim Solomon Mahlangu House. Seabe has called on students to move to the Trinity House Catholic Church back on campus. "We need to be able to reclaim Solomon Mahlangu House. It belongs to us and we are not going to leave Solomon [House] to the police or private security. We are going to take back Solomon House." The group is currently moving along Jorissen Street and is expected to head back to campus shortly. Two police helicopters continue to hover over campus.
