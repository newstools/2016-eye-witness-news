The DAâ€™s Mabine Seabe says Hlaudi Motsoeneng should not be employed in any capacity at the SABC. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) and Congress of the People (Cope) will today join forces today as they march to the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) headquarters, in protest against the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as group executive for corporate affairs. The public broadcaster made the announcement last week after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a ruling in which Motsoeneng's permanent appointment as chief operating officer was found to be unlawful and irregular. The DA's Mabine Seabe says Motsoeneng should not be employed in any capacity at the SABC. "Hlaudi Motsoeneng should not be serving in any capacity at the SABC and it does undermine the Public Protector and the judiciary. As such, the DA will be leading a protest at the SABC's headquarters on Monday." Cope's Dennis Bloem says they will also insist that the SABC board be dissolved. "We are calling on civil society and all TV licence payers to be part of this march."
