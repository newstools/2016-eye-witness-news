On Tuesday, UCT made an urgent application to the high court to interdict students from protesting on campus. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has now ordered police and law enforcement officials to refrain from using live ammunition during campus protests. The court has advised University of Cape Town (UCT) it's amended an order it granted to the institution earlier this week. On Tuesday, UCT made an urgent application to the high court to interdict students from protesting on campus. The university's Elija Moholola says the second clause directs police and local law enforcement officials to exercise extreme restraint. &quot;The first clause states that until the end of the deferred examination period, currently scheduled to end on 10 February 2017, respondents are interdicted and restrained from gathering in protest within 200 meters from specified UCT venues.&quot;
