Nigerias investigating whether MTN unlawfully repatriated $13.92bn from Nigeria between 2006 and 2016. ABUJA Citigroup has denied being involved in any illegal foreign currency transfer on behalf of MTN Group, according to a presentation the United States bank gave to the Nigerian parliament. Nigeria is investigating whether South African telecoms company MTN unlawfully repatriated $13.92 billion from Nigeria between 2006 and 2016. We wish to state categorically that Citibank Nigeria Limited was at no time involved in any illegal foreign currency repatriation on behalf of MTNN (MTN Nigeria) or any other customer, Citibank said in a presentation to parliament last week. Earlier this month, the mobile network denied allegations it illegally repatriated the money from Nigeria. The allegations made against MTN are completely unfounded and without any merit, MTN Nigeria Chief Executive Ferdi Moolman said in a statement. The group has also appointed a new regulatory affairs chief after the earlier fine dragged Africas biggest mobile operator by users to its first-ever half-yearly loss. The firm had already been fined US$1 billion by the African country for missing a deadline to disconnect inactive SIM cards.
