Zwane says he agrees with earlier statements that those who claim state capture have no understanding of it. JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says he agrees with the Deputy Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Kebby Maphatsoe that, contrary to popular belief, the state has not been captured. Speaking to Eyewitness News on the side lines of the South African National Military Veterans Association national general council yesterday, Zwane also said he supports Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan as he faces fraud charges. Yesterday, Maphatsoe said people who claim that the state has been capture have no understanding of what state capture is. Zwane says he agrees with him. &quot;People must not just use the word 'state capture' willy-nilly, and start to paint other South Africans in that paint.&quot; Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela investigated claims that the Gupta family has had undue influence on President Jacob Zuma and the state-following complaints. That report was meant to be released on Madonsela's last day in office but is now under lock and key, pending legal action by the President. Zuma says he needs more time to respond to the application filed this week by former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor, who wants to be listed as a respondent in the case. At the Democratic Alliance has said it will not tolerate further delays in the state capture matter, after President Zuma indicated that he wants a postponement. State attorney Isaac Chowe on Wednesday said Zuma's team would be opposing Mentor's application. The party says it will not &quot;subject the people of South Africa to the President's political games and 11th hour interventions&quot;. Additional reporting by Gia Nicolaides
