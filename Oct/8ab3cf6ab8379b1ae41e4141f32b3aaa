UCT's Elijah Moholola says the affected students have also been requested to clear their residences. CAPE TOWN Undergraduate medical students at University of Cape Town (UCT) will complete the remainder of the 2016 academic programme in January. The Health Sciences Faculty announced yesterday course curriculums and exams for students in years one to three will be concluded in a mini-semester next year. The university's Elijah Moholola adds the affected students have also been requested to clear their residences. The academic programme for the rest of the Faculty of Health Sciences continues. Last week, the institution said unless the academic programme resumes soon, the 2016 academic year will be lost. UCT said its out of time to salvage the 2016 academic year. Moholola says despite #FeesMustFall protests the institution remains committed to concluding the academic programme.
