The students were handcuffed for disrupting classes at the institutions medical campus in Parktown. JOHANNESBURG - Four Wits Universitystudents who were arrested for contravening a court interdict have each been released on R1,000bail. The students were handcuffedfor disrupting classes at the institutions medical campus in Parktown on Friday. On the same day, students and private security clashed at the entrance of the campuswhen protesters wanted to access one of the buildings to mobilise non-protesting students. Wits SRC general secretary Fasiha Hassan said, They were arrested for contravention of a court interdict because we were protesting at medical school and they got arrested at that protest. Meanwhile, Wits University vice-chancellor Adam Habibdismissed rumours that he or any member of management were targeting student leaders involved in the #FeesMustFall protests. Students last week claimed that their leaders were being targeted by police. Last weekend student leader Mcebo Dlaminiwas arrested and subsequently charged with damage to property, theft, assault and contravening a court order. He is due back in court next month. Habib said the university was not in the business of targeting student leaders. I am sure the national commissioner will be very willing to argue that he has said publicly that there is no attempt to target individuals. We have engaged student leaders to try and ensure that if they are arrested we try and address their certain circumstances. Additional reporting by Katleho Sekhotho.
