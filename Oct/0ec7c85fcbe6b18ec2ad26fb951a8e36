The singer has defended Kim Kardashian West in the wake of her Paris robbery. Now, the All of Me hitmaker has taken the time to speak out against critics who say the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star should have had tighter security. Speaking on American radio station SiriusXM, the 37-year-old musician said: "You can't stop every situation from happening. People were criticising, you know, security, this and that, but five people with guns come up? I don't care if you've got two or three security people -- they got to back up. You don't want to get in a gunfight... You've got five armed guys coming, like, there's not really much you can do to stop that. Just give them what they want and escape with your life, you know?" The Tonight singer's comments come after his wife Chrissy Teigen - with whom he shares six-month-old daughter Luna - was one of the first celebrities to take to Twitter to show solidarity for the beauty after her attack. She wrote: "Fame is interesting. Celebs are supposed to love you guys while also knowing you'd make a meme of our dead bodies to get retweets (sic)" Meanwhile, Kim's sister Khlo√© Kardashian recently revealed that whilst the star isn't physically harmed by the theft, she isn't "doing that well". She said: "She's not doing that well. It's incredibly traumatic what happened to her, but our family is super close and great and we'll get through it together. "We do appreciate all of your guys' love and support. It will take time. It was horrible what happened to her."
