PORT ELIZABETH - A former employee of murder accused Christopher Panayiotouclaims he came across a bag containing R30,000, which was apparently meant to be paid to the alleged middle man who arranged his wife's killing. Panayiotou is accused of hiring men to kill his wife, Jayde, in April last year. The businessman and two others are on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Mawonga Ndedwa worked at Panayiotous OK Grocer store before he was fired for stealing. He claims to have come across a bag that contains R30,000 in the storeroom, a week before Jaydes murder. He has testified Panayiotou told him to give the money to alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni, who was a bouncer at Panayiotous club. Ndedwa, however, says he didnt see Siyoni on the day. He alleges Panayiotou informed him the following day he had already handed the money to Siyoni. The defence has accused Ndedwa of lying.
