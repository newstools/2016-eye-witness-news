Dlamini, a student leader at Wits, is appearing at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court on five charges. JOHANNESBURG - The bail application of former Wits SRC president Mcebo Dlamini is currently underway at the Johannesburg Magistrates Court. The # FeesMustFall leader was arrested in the early hours of Sunday morning at his residence. He faces charges of public violence, theft, malicious damage to property assault and contravention of a court order. Dlamini's court appearance began with the State bringing up some violent altercations between the student leader and police. But his lawyer Mongezi Ntanga says Dlamini's arrest is believed to be politically motivated, to destabilize the #FeesMustFall movement. He says the student leader's detention could fuel further unrest across the country.
