Many people were left confused and some angry after Donald Trumps comments on bad hombres. CAPE TOWN Many people were left confused and some angry after Donald Trumps comments on bad hombres as the Republican presidential candidate and Hillary Clinton squared off in the final presidential debate on Wednesday. Once again, Trump shared his dream of building a wall as he spoke about immigration. He then dropped the term bad hombres. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We'll get them out, secure the border and once the border is secured at a later date we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out, the Republican said. Merriam Webster cleared confusion around the term, with an hombre/ombre/ombr explainer, as many people missed the h and used ombre instead of hombre online, which quickly turned into a hair joke. WATCH: Bad hombres... According to Merriam-Webster, online searches for the word hombre, a Spanish word for man, spiked by 120,000% over the hourly average following Trumps comments. But so did lookups for 'ombr', &quot;having colours or tones that shade into each other,&quot; and 'ombre', &quot;an old three-handed card game.&quot; Somehow, this night ends with us writing an hombre/ombre/ombr explainer. Of course it does. #debatenight https://t.co/AZCuU8OohO&mdash; Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) October 20, 2016 Somehow, this night ends with us writing an hombre/ombre/ombr explainer.
