The City of Cape Town has relaunched an 87-year-old social housing organisation last week. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says it is facing unprecedented pressures around housing issues. The city's Benedicta van Minnen shared this sentiment during the relaunch of the 87-year-old social housing organisation Communicare last week. Van Minnen says although the city has set aside R230 million for housing projects this year, partner-driven solutions like Communicare are also critical. "They are changing their tenant mix and we are introducing opportunities with normal market rates, to improve sustainability and enable the cross subsidization of vulnerable tenants. They are also planning to redevelop some of the previous developments."
