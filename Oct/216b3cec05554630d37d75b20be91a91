The league has reacted to the shooting of student leader Shaeera Kalla at Wits yesterday. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress Womens League (ANCWL) has condemned what it calls police brutality during fees must fall demonstrations at South African universities. The league has reacted to yesterdays shooting at Wits Universityin which student leader Shaeera Kalla was struck 13 times by rubber bulletswhen police tried to disperse protesters. Claims that police used excessive force against students will now be the subject of an investigation by police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate. The ANCWL's Meokgo Matuba says while the organisation believes in the role of the law enforcement officers in restoring order at universities, violent attacks on protesting students must stop. We call on police to respond but in a very cautious and stable manner, rather than what we are seeing at universities. The acting police commissioner has condemned the shooting of Kalla and has called on police to exercise maximum restraint within the confines of the law. The league says while it respects the rights of students to protest peacefully, violence and destruction of property cannot be justified. WATCH: Wits FMF leaders targeted by police
