Two buses and a police vehicle were set alight in Braamfontein yesterday. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has condemned the damage to property during recent protests in Braamfontein. Two buses and a police vehicle were set alight yesterday, after another day of clashes between law enforcement and protesting Wits University students. However, there is still no confirmation on whether the acts of arson and protests are linked. Earlier this month another bus was burned when protests spilled onto the streets of the Johannesburg city centre. Mashaba says while he understands the call for free tertiary education, violence and the destruction of property cannot be tolerated. Mayoral spokesperson Tony Taverna-Turisan says, &quot;We cannot stand for criminal activity. The mayor's taken an oath of office to uphold and protect the Constitution and the residents of Johannesburg, and the criminality has to stop.&quot;
