Shaun Abrahams is facing a backlash after he said the NPA is withdrawing charges against Pravin Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG - There are widespread calls for National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams to resign or be disbarred following his U-turn on the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former South African Revenue Service bosses Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay. Abrahams is facing a backlash after Mondays announcement that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is withdrawing charges against Gordhan, Magashula and Pillay.Several political parties, civil society organisations and commentators say Abrahams must now resign if the NPA is to retain any credibility. But the NDPP says he will not go. The second question was: Will I resign? Certainly not, certainly not,&quot; he said during a press conference called to announce the decision to drop the fraud charges.Abrahams was also vague about whether any other heads would roll at the NPA following this debacle. The Economic Freedom Fighters has written to the chairperson of the General Council of the Bar (GCB) asking it to disbar Abrahams, listing numerous reasons for it to do so.

The GCB can bring an application for Abrahams to be struck from the roll if he is not a fit and proper person or the president can choose to institute an inquiry into his fitness to hold office. Meanwhile, Freedom Under Law head and former Constitutional Court judge Johann Kriegler says he has no faith in the ability of Abrahams to make the right decisions in the post.He says it seems Abrahams doesn't know what he's doing. I think he s a man that doesn t understand the enormity of the harm that he personally has done. [WATCH] Pravin Gordhan, Oupa Magashula &amp; Ivan Pillay are off the hook
