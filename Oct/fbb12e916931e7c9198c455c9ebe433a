The boys mother was also wounded during the incident outside a block of flats on Saturday. CAPE TOWN - A two-year-old child has been shot and killed in Atlantis. The little boy was hit by a stray bullet outside a block of flats on Saturday. His mother was also wounded in the incident. Ward councillor Barbara Rass says: It is very tragic and it saddens me to think that this happens to innocent children at the hands of people who are instructed to kill, but they kill innocent children. It's unclear if the shooting is gang-related.
