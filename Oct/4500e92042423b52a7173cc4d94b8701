The EFF leader filed his replying affidavit in the matter, which is due to be heard in court next week. JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema says it's improper for President Jacob Zuma to contest the finality of the state capture report at this stage. Malema filed his replying affidavit yesterday which is due to be heard in court next week. Zuma meanwhile has invited the new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to confirm whether the report is indeed final. In Malemas replying affidavit he states that it is common cause that the state capture report is final and says that it's opportunistic for the president to contest this, now that the court order has been granted. At the same time, Malema says that his party has no reason yet to doubt the new Public Protector's integrity but says that they are concerned about her initial statement that the state capture report was not her priority. Although the EFF does not go as far as the Democratic Alliance in expressing its lack of confidence in Mkhwebane, Malema says they will persist with the counter application to compel her to release the report as it is in the public interest.
