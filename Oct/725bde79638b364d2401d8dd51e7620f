The president filed his replying affidavit yesterday in his application to stop the report's release. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has invited the new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to confirm whether the state capture report is indeed final. Zuma filed his replying affidavit yesterday regarding his application to stop the release of the state capture report. The matter will be heard in court next week. In President Zuma's replying affidavit, he states that he only became an implanted person in the state capture report on the second of this month. Zuma maintains that he wasn't given the opportunity to interview witnesses who implicated him in this investigation. He also stated that its unclear if the report is final or not and the only way to determine this is for the new Public Protector to clarify the issue. EFF leader Julius Malema also filed his answering affidavit and says the President cannot contest the finality of the report at this stage because he accepted the court order from last week. Zuma's application will be heard next week.
