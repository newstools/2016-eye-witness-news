The student leader was hit by a car during a #FeesMustFall protest last week. PRETORIA - Tshwane University of Technology’s (TUT) vice-chancellor Lourens van Staden says the institution will honour late student Benjamin Phehla by renaming one of its bursaries after him. Van Staden was speaking at the memorial service of Phehla, which was attended by scores of mourners at the university's Soshanguve campus on Thursday. Phehla was hit by a car during a #FeesMustFall protest last week.  The announcement to rename a bursary after Phehla has been welcomed by the students, who say they’ll respect Phehla’s call to have classes resume. However, students say they’ll continue to fight for free education. TUT chancellor and former deputy minister of health Dr Gwen Ramokgopa says she supports the students' call for free education. “We should be the first people to support all students who are marching.” Phehla will be buried on Saturday at his home near Hammanskraal.
