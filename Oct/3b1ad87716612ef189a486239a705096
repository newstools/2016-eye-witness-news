The SALC says SAs decision could prompt other countries to withdraw from the ICC. PRETORIA The Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) has warned that South Africa's decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) signals the beginning of the end for the court. Government confirmed yesterday that it has notified the United Nations Security Council and will soon initiate parliamentary process to repeal the implementation of the Rome Statute. It was the litigation centre which brought the application in June last year to compel the government to arrest Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir when he attended the African Union summit in Sandton. Government believes its commitment to the international court undermines its international relations efforts at negotiating peace. SALCs Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh says South Africas decision could prompt other countries to withdraw from the ICC. Currently South Africa and Burundi have indicated their intention to withdraw and I imagine that Kenya is not behind and several other countries Lawyers for human rights says it is concerned the decision does not comply with the Constitution and domestic legislation relating to obligations towards international criminal justice. Freedom Under Law says the decision is unlawful and unconstitutional and is an example of the executives increasingly contemptuous and brazen disregard for the law. While the African National Congress has welcomed the move, the Democratic Alliance says it will challenge it in court.
