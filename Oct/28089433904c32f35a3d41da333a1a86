Tito Mboweni says it can be difficult to predict what a political party would do when it comes under pressure. JOHANNESBURG - Former Reserve Bank governor and African National Congress(ANC) national executive committee member Tito Mboweni says there is a risk that the party could behave irrationally as it comes under pressure during elections. He says that could place some independent institutions under pressure. The ANC lost control of three metros during the local polls in August. Mboweni says it can be difficult to predict what a political party would do when it comes under pressure. In this kind of situation, irrationality could creep in and you might see more abuse of state institutions, actually sometimes lack of foresight and the need to control these institutions. But he says it is possible for the ANC to recoup the group that its lost, depending on the kind of leader it chooses next year. LISTEN: Tito Mboweni on ANC &amp; Gordhan
