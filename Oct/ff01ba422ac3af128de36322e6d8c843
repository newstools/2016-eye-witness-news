Parliament s Police Committee won&#39;t be instituting disciplinary proceedings against him. CAPE TOWN -&nbsp;Independent Police Investigative Directorate&nbsp;(Ipid) head&nbsp;Robert McBride&nbsp;can return to work tomorrow. Parliament&rsquo;s Police Committee&nbsp;will not be instituting disciplinary proceedings against him, as requested by Police Minister Nathi Nhleko. McBride was suspended 16 months ago. The Constitutional Court last month declared McBride&rsquo;s suspension unlawful.&nbsp; It suspended this ruling to give Nhleko and Parliament 30 days to begin a disciplinary process to remove him. The Constitutional Court&rsquo;s deadline expired today.&nbsp; Parliament&rsquo;s police committee was to have dealt with the matter this morning.&nbsp; Committee chair Francois Beukman says legal opinion from Parliament was clear, there must first be a resolution by the National Assembly for the committee to deal with the matter. &ldquo;Currently, there&rsquo;s no House resolution, so the committee can&rsquo;t deal with the matter.&rdquo; The House is only scheduled to sit next Tuesday. Speaker Baleka&nbsp;Mbete warned Nhleko last week that the 30-day deadline&nbsp;set by the court would likely be missed. That appears to mean that nothing prevents McBride from returning to work tomorrow morning.
