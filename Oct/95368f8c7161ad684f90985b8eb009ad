Mawonga Ndedwa says Panayiotou would often give him airtime and then take his phone to place calls. CAPE TOWN A former employee of murder accused Christopher Panayiotou claims his ex-boss regularly borrowed his cellphone in the weeks leading up to his wife's murder. Mawonga Ndedwa was under cross-examination in the Port Elizabeth High Court, in the trial against Panayiotou and two others. The PE businessman's believed to have orchestrated his wife Jayde Panayiotou's murder in April last year. Ndedwa says the murder accused would often give him airtime and then take his phone to place calls. The State alleges Panayiotou would use his employee's cellphone to call suspected middleman Luthando siyoni, who allegedly is the hitmen. At least 27 calls were made between Ndedwa and Siyoni's phones during the two weeks before Jaydes murder. The defence has however highlighted several inconsistencies in the witness testimony. Times and dates in his testimony differed to those in his police affidavit. Cross-examination resumes in Monday.
