Sadtu is opposed to systemic tests and believes they overburden teachers. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department has approached the High Court for an interdict to prevent teachers union Sadtu and student organisation Cosas from disrupting systemic tests at provincial schools. Among other things, the department uses the results of the annual tests to track learner progress and to inform teacher training. But Sadtu is opposed to the assessments and believes they overburden teachers. Provincial Education MEC Debbie Schfer says: Sadtu is complaining about the amount it costs us to administer these tests. They are adding to these costs with misconduct and the state of the matter is that its not for Sadtu to decide. This is a decision of the department. Sadtu is there to represent its members in collective bargaining and conditions of employment, this is not one of those.
