The state capture report is now under lock and key at the Public Protector's office. JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has confirmed that an investigation into possible undue political influence by the Guptas, who are said to be friends of President Jacob Zuma, was final. Zuma filed an affidavit to court on Tuesday seeking clarification over whether he would be able to question witnesses himself before Thuli Madonsela finalised its report. In President Zuma's replying affidavit, he states that he only became an implicated person in the state capture report on the second of this month. &quot;The Public Protector has the President's latest affidavit and has through the attorneys confirmed that the report was finalised and signed ... on 14 October 2016,&quot; Mkhwebane's spokesperson Kgalalelo Masibi said. The state capture report, which was due to be released on Madonsela's last day in office, is now under lock and key, pending legal action by Zuma.
