UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says the ICC is central to global efforts to prevent conflict. PRETORIA - United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moonsays he hopes South Africa will reconsider its decision to quit the ICC before the withdrawal takes effect. The UN chief also recalls the significant role played by South Africa in the establishment of the court, including being one of the first signatories of the treaty founding it. The country's withdrawal from the ICC will only come into effect one year after notification to the UN Secretary-General, who is the depositary. Ban says the ICC is central to global efforts to end impunity and prevent conflict. He is confident that UN Member States will continue to further strengthen the court, thus helping to deter future atrocities across the globe. He hopes that states that may have concerns regarding the functioning of the court seek to resolve these matters in the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute that founded the court.
