CAPE TOWN A witness claims his former boss Christopher Panayiotoupaid him R1,000 to get rid of a phone allegedly used to orchestrate his wifes murder.

Mawongo Ndedwa worked at the Panayiotous OK Grocers for four years and he is now testifying against his former boss. The State has provided cellphone records showing several calls placed from Ndedwas phone to alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni about two weeks before the victim was killed. Ndedwa told the court Christopher Panayiotou used his phone to call Siyoni. He claims that after Jaydes murder, her husband asked him to part ways with his phone. Ndedwa testified that Christopher told him to stop using the SIM card as it would cause police to start following him. He claims Panayiotou destroyed the SIM and gave him money to buy a new phone. Ndedwa says he later went to police after seeing his cellphone number in a local newspaper.
