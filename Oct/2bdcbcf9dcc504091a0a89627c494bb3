Passengers were trapped in the tunnel between the Malboro and Sandton stations this afternoon. JOHANNESBURG - Gautrain says services between OR Tambo and Sandton as well as Malboro and Park Station have now resumed following a disruption caused by power failure. Passengers were trapped in the tunnel between the Malboro and Sandton stations this afternoon, and had to be evacuated when their commute came to a sudden halt. Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager has apologised for the inconvenience. &quot;The Gautrain train service has been fully restored, and will be back on schedule by 16h00 this afternoon. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.&quot; A commuter says he and other passengers had to walk over three kilometres in the tunnel until they reached Sandton station. &quot;I was not evacuated with the other train, because I walked out. I don't know if another train came to help, but I was so panicky because I am asthmatic that I just got off and walked towards Sandton.&quot;
