It's reported there are informal discussions to have charges against Gordhan, Pillay and Magashula dropped. JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says there is no truth to reports that it's head, Shaun Abrahams, is considering dropping the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The City Press is reporting that informal discussions are underway between Abrahams, Gordhan's lawyers and those of former South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula to have the fraud charges against the three men dropped. They are expected to appear in court on Wednesday for their handling of an early retirement payout for Pillay, who was then reinstated as a contractor. According to the newspaper, Abrahams has drafted a letter which is expected to communicate his intention to drop the charges before Wednesday's court date. The publication adds that another reason for his decision to backtrack is the recent alleged kidnapping and assault of Sars official, Vlok Symington by members of the Hawks. But NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku says this is not true. &quot;The national director, after receiving representations from Mr Pillay and Mr Magashula, is now applying his mind to the matter. A decision has not been taken.&quot;
