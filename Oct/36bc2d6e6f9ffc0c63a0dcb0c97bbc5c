The suspect has been linked to the murder of Constable Ben Koopman earlier this year. He was arrested on Friday by the Hawks. CCTV footage shows Koopman was ambushed by two suspects as he left his house in Eerste River in March. The pair fled the scene with the 53-year-old officer's service pistol and a hand radio. Three suspects were taken into custody shortly after the murder, but none of them were charged. Seven months after the attack, a 27-year-old is expected to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrates Court in connection with the murder. The suspect was not among those previously questioned.
