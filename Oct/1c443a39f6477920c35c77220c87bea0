The theme for this yearâ€™s World Mental Health Day is psychologic first aid. JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN - As today marks World Mental Health Day, health organisations say more needs to be done to create awareness around mental health illnesses, calling for governments around the world to take the lives of psychiatric patients more seriously.  Earlier this year, the Gauteng Health Department revealed that 36 psychiatric patients, who were transferred to various non-governmental organisations across the province from Life Healthcare Esidimeni, died. They were moved from Esidimeni facilities after the department terminated its contract with Esidimeni. Last month, another patient, from the same facility died. As health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba investigated the deaths of 37 psychiatric patients from Esidimeni, the facility has confirmed that on average it lost 8.25 patients per month across its institutions in Gauteng between October 2013 and September 2015. SA Medical Association Chairperson Dr Mzukisi Grootboom says this proves that mental health is a problem that need urgent attention. "We need to realise that it can affect any one of us."  The theme for this year's World Mental Health Day is 'psychologic first aid'. 'UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS COST SA OVER R40 BILLION' Meanwhile, the Psychiatry Management Group says untreated mental illness cost the South African economy more than R40 billion a year. To mark World Mental Health Day, the group has called on employers to create pro-active mental health awareness programmes. The group's Renata Schoeman says only 25 percent of South Africans suffering from mental illness receive treatment. "If you look at per affected individual it decrease their earnings per year to about R55,000 and if you add indirect costs of absenteeism, presentism and impact on the workplace then it adds up to around R40 billion a year."
