Tina Joemat-Pettersson &amp; Necsa officials are in Parliament to face the Portfolio Committee on Energy. CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have heard governments nuclear build programme is crucial to the future of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa). Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson and Necsa officials are in Parliament to face the Portfolio Committee on Energy. They briefed the committee on the organisations annual reports for the two previous financial years. The committee has been told that the Auditor-General has raised concern over Necsas financial sustainability because its not making enough revenue. Democratic Alliance MP Gordon MacKay asked whether the State Agencys future is intertwined with the nuclear programme. How are they planning to procure or acquire nuclear reactors considering that their financials are appalling? And how will the tender process take place? Necsa CEO Phumzile Tshelane says the companys sustainability is not tied to the project. The answer is a clear and unequivocal no; its not intertwined, but the nuclear build programme is very important to Necsas future. Tshelane says the Nuclear Energy Act allows Necsa to be involved in the inception and completion of any nuclear projects.
