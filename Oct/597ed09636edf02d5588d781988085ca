Ramaphosa also condemned the destruction of property at some institutions, saying it must stop. JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosasays students protesting over free higher education are raising a critical issue for the future of the country. Ramaphosa has, however, condemned the recent vandalism and destruction of property at some institutions saying it must stop. He was speaking in Rosebank this morning at the electoral institute for sustainable democracys 20th anniversary symposium. The deputy president says as democracies on the continent develop, governments need to pay particular attention to managing disaffection and dissent. Ramaphosa says the right to peaceful protests, freedom of association and expression are fundamental pillars of a democratic society but he says South Africa and many other African countries often struggle to manage tension. As government representatives, we need to put our ears on the ground and we need to pay heed to the dissatisfaction that ordinary people express. He says these rights do not include permission to destroy the very infrastructure thats needed for the future of the country. But the manner in which that dissent is expressed should not undermine the value principle on which the democratic order is built. The deputy president says the continent is on the right track but a lot still needs to be done.
