The union has criticised the way in which the university's council and management handled allegations of sexual assault and mismanagement levelled against Nevuthalu.Union chairperson, Ben Turner, wants to know why Nevuthalu is on special leave. They could have acted against the vice chancellor because council has been aware of some of the allegations levelled against the vice-chancellor. CPUT Council Chairperson Mbulelo Bikwani says the matter will be discussed at a later stage but adds now is not the time to do so. The university is not prepared to discuss this matter on air. The time is not now. The union also believes CPUT management could have handled fees related protests better.(Edited by Neo Koza)
