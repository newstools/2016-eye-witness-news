Students plan to take their fee demands to Parliament during Minister Gordhan's mini budget speech. JOHANNESBURG - The University of the Western Cape's Fees Will Fall movement says management must lead their march to Parliament tomorrow. Leaders of the student movement have also called on civil society to join the march in demand of free, decolonised education. They sent an e-mail to UWC management over the weekend, calling on them to support the protest. Under the banner Fees Will Fall, campaign leaders say management should join them at Unibel station, to catch a train to the Cape Town CBD at 8:55 on Wednesday morning. Protesting students plan to take the demand for no universi ty fees to Parliament at the time when Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is set to deliver his Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. Fees Will Fall activist Simnikiwe Fawula explains: When they partake, it symbolizes that they are in solidarity or they understand the call for free education by students. University management has confirmed receiving the request and will address the matter later today. At UWC some students are preparing for exams online because face-to-face tuition has been suspended.
