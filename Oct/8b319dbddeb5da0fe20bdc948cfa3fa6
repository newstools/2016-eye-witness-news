CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG As student protests continue across some universities, Wits and UCT say they are adamant they will complete the 2016 academic programme. Last week, protests at Wits escalatedwith student leader Shaeera Kalla being shot 13 times in the back with rubber bullets. A number of other students were also injured when police lobbed stun grenades and used teargas to disperse students. Habib says while an Ipid investigation is underway regarding Kalla's injuries, he maintains the students were protesting outside the legal boundaries. He says if the university is shutdown, it would affect the majority of black students. They are the ones dont have the luxury to sacrifice the year and its unconscionable for others to demand that they make sacrifices when you dont know their personal circumstances. Our focus is to finish in the next three to four days. Meanwhile, online tuition and alternative faculty specific learning methods have been rolled out at UCT. Spokesperson Elijah Moholola says: Examinations are scheduled to commence on 7 November 2016 and a timetable has already been released to students. It will be possible for students to defer their 2016 exams to January 2017.
