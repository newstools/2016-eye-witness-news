The DA is challenging governments decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute on procedural grounds. PRETORIA - Ju stice Mini ster Michael Ma sutha said on Monday he expected the Democratic Alliance(DA)to exhaust parliamentary processes instead of turning to the courts over governments decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The minister was responding to the opposition partys application to the Constitutional Court to review and set aside government decision to withdraw from the ICC. Government claims that itsobligations to the court hinders its international relations,particularly where peaceful negotiations are required. The move was prompted bya high court finding that government was legally obliged to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he was in South Africa last June. Al-Bashir slipped out of the country in contravention of that court order. Masutha says the party could have debated the matter in Parliament when he makes a ministerial statement on the move, adding hes concerned by the route the DA has taken. It seems as if we are using the courts to resolve every political issue, or if we feel that the political platform that the Constitution provides us doesnt help us get our way, we are very quick run to courts. The party filed its papers at the Constitutional Court yesterday.
