JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) stalwart Frene Ginwala has come out in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, saying he is a respectable person. Ginwala has also criticised President Jacob Zuma for not answering questions posed by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela regarding the state capture probe. In an exclusive interview with Eyewitness News on wide range of issues, Ginwala described the current political developments in the country as a mess. Ginwala says other senior ANC leaders like Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi have done well by supporting Gordhan. “He’s always been a respectable person, I don’t know anything that would make him lose that respect.” The former National Assembly speaker and now deputy chair of the ANC integrity committee also weighed in on the state capture report, questioning why Zuma hasn’t yet answered questions sent to him by Madonsela. “Madonsela says she’s been waiting since March, so we must put pressure on the president.” She has called on other ANC leaders and members to speak out against what she’s described as a political mess.
