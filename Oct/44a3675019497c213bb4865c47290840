The president has given notice of his intention to suspend Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. JOHANNESBURG - The lawyer for deputy National Prosecuting Authority(NPA) head Nomgcobo Jiba has confirmed she will make representations to President Jacob Zuma to explain why she should not be suspended. The president has given notice of his intention to suspend Jiba and the NPA's commercial crimes head Lawrence Mrwebi, pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. The High Court in Pretoria ruled they were not fit and proper to be advocates. Jiba's attorney, Zola Majavu, says she's still on special leave and waiting to hear if this inquiry will go ahead. Former NPA head Mxolisi Nxasana clashed with Jiba while he was at the institution, saying an inquiry won't solve anything. He had asked the president to set up this inquiry, but he received no answer to his request.
