Learners have embarked on protest action demanding safe schools and proper sanitation. CAPE TOWN Learners from public schools in Observatory, Khayelitsha, Langa and Gugulethu embarked on protest action demanding safe schools and proper sanitation. Representatives of Equal Education,a non-governmental organisation which facilitated the march, say they will consider extending their protest action to the Western Cape Education Department(WCED) in the coming weeks. The organisations Buhle Booi says they presented social audits on the issues to provincial education MEC Debbie Schafer. The leadership committee of Equal Education will meet this week to find a plan. It will be their decision whether they are taking all 42 schools to the WCED. The organisations Nishal Robb says they have not received proper responses from the Western Cape government after they presented social audits to different departments. Its not something that is done lightly, but its done in response to a situation in which officials have been sitting with serious information about school safety in the province; about sanitation and lack of access for disabled learners since April. Through rounds and rounds of meetings and engagements, we are yet to receive a serious response. The MEC says she will respond to the report on Monday. We are going to respond on Monday. They took a year to do their social audit. They gave us the document and then demanded that we give our response within two weeks. It was over 100 pages and it takes time to give a coherent response to a document like that.
