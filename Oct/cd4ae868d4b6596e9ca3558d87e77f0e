The incident at Sars, I heard whispers about it to be frank. I have no formal report yet, I haven t had a chance to look at it and I will ask Moyane for some explanation as soon as I get a chance. If this is true, it s unacceptable behavior. It s understood Moyane accidentaly e-mailed questions from the Hawks to Symington, which he in turn refused to hand over.Gordhan says he ll be investigating the matter.
