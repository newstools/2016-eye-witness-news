Zuma's application to interdict the release of the state capture report will be heard tomorrow. JOHANNESBURG - Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen has filed another urgent application to halt the release of the state capture report. Van Rooyen previously applied to interdict the report and then withdrew it saying former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had made no adverse findings against him and that there would be no purpose in pursuing the application. At the same time, President Jacob Zuma's application to interdict the state capture report is set to be heard by a full bench of judges this week and has been extended. The case had initially been set down for Tuesday only, but the office of North Gauteng deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba has sent a letter to Zuma's legal team indicating that arguments will be heard over two days. Zuma wants the matter to be postponed, saying he needs more time to respond to an affidavit filed last week by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor who wants to be listed as a respondent in the case. Last week, Zuma's legal team indicated that they would ask for a postponement in the state capture case because Mentor had only recently filed her affidavit and they need an opportunity to reply. Ledwaba responded by saying that all responses must be filed by the weekend and heads of arguments submitted as a full bench of judges will be hearing the matter. Opposition parties involved in the matter have all opposed a postponement. The Democratic Alliance's Mabine Seabe says this is another delay tactic by Zuma. &quot;President Jacob Zuma is playing nothing more than delaying games, essentially delaying the inevitable, which is the release of this report.&quot; The highly anticipated state capture report, is currently under lock and key at the Public Protector's office.
