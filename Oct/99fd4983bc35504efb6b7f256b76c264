Mthembu says he too is willing to resign. But the party's Zizi Kodwa says the committee is going nowhere. It would be irresponsible of the NEC to resign because it did not elect itself. Its not accountable to itself, its accountable to the branches of the ANC. Mthembu's call has been to be met with criticism from some quarters in the ANC. The party's youth league and the MK Military Veterans Association have slammed him, saying he should step down. The chief whip explains that he believes Gordhan is the targetof a political agenda Mthembu says he's going public with this case because of what's happened to Gordhan. From where some of us are seated, this is indeed pursuing a person for political expediency. And he says warnings to deal with this issue have been ignored. In various NEC meetings we said leadership deals with this matter because this is akin to what happened to the deputy president at a particular political time. Mthembu also says he doesn't believe his going public with these statements will stop him from doing his job as ANC chief whip.
