The Department of Social Development has revealed that it has housed 103 victims in 2016. CAPE TOWN - More than a hundred cases of human trafficking have been reported in South Africa this year. The Department of Social Development has revealed that it has housed 103 victims in 2016, compared to 41 in the previous year.  As part of Human Trafficking Awareness Week, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) is partnering with the University of Johannesburg to raise awareness around the problem. The IOM's Zoe Rohde says they've come across cases where sailors have been trafficked from Asia. "We've also had cases of Thai, Chinese and Eastern European women being trafficked into South Africa for commercial sexual exploitation. We also have case of people being trafficked within the country for these reasons, but also for other reasons such as domestic servitude." Rohde adds they've found people in rural areas are targeted by traffickers. "But the reality is when people come to the urban areas, Cape Town for example, they're being kept under lock-and-key as slaves in people's private homes. The conditions that they were promised don't come into fruition." Last year, the organisation assisted 39 human trafficking victims to return to their countries of origin.
