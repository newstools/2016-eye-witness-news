Breytenbach and her attorney are accused of defeating the ends of justice and contravening the NPA Act. PRETORIA - The State has led evidence which suggests former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) prosecutor Glynnis Breytenbach destroyed documents which showed an improper relationship with a defence attorney on cases she had dealt with. Breytenbach and her attorney are on trial in the Pretoria North Magistrates' Court. The pair are accused of defeating the ends of justice and contravening the NPA Act by deleting files from Breytenbach's official laptop in 2012. NPA internal investigator Hercules Wasserman told the court he retrieved shredded documents on Breytenbach's official laptop which related to a business interest. He says the business involved Breytenbach and an attorney, Andre Bezuidenhout, who acted as the defence in various cases she had handled. Wassermann says there had been numerous allegations against Breytenbach of not acting impartially in matters. He says he found another document which showed a business interest involving Nathan Kirsh, who had been a complainant in a matter the NPA was dealing with. Defence advocate Barry Roux objected to Wasserman's reliance on hearsay evidence, adding that he would deal with the business allegations during cross-examination.
