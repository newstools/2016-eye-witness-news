The City of eThekwini has been warned it will be stripped of the Games unless it meets a handful conditions. CAPE TOWN - Sascoc president&nbsp;Gideon Sam&nbsp;says the Commonwealth Games set to be hosted by Durban in 2022 hangs in the&nbsp;balance. The City of eThekwini has recently been warned by&nbsp;Commonwealth Games Federation&nbsp;(CGF) President Louise Martin that it will be stripped of the Games unless it meets a handful of conditions by 30 November. Worryingly, Durban 2022 is still without a Local Organising Committee, while the South African government has also not signed the host city contract or confirmed underwriting arrangements nor made any payments to the CGF. However, the CGF have said they remain committed to helping Durban if needs be, but stress they may have to search for alternatives. For South Africa and Durban, Sports and Recreation Director General Alec Moemi is working on providing the CGF with a definitive answer for the&nbsp;November&nbsp;deadline. Sam explains the possible outcomes that could be given to the CGF. &ldquo;The announcement can go either way to say we&rsquo;re ready to move forward, or we&rsquo;ve looked at our conditions and resources in the country and we feel that we should not go ahead. I think the CGF could give us that answer by 30 [November].&rdquo; Sam is confident the answers that need to be provided to the CGF will be done in timeous&nbsp;fashion. &ldquo;We have raised our issues and asked if we could ensure that by 30 November, we will have these issues in place. The DG himself now is dealing with outstanding issues and it shouldn&rsquo;t take long until they make the proper announcement.&rdquo; (Edited by Shimoney Regter) CAPE TOWN - Sascoc president&nbsp;Gideon Sam&nbsp;says the Commonwealth Games set to be hosted by Durban in 2022 hangs in the&nbsp;balance.The City of eThekwini has recently been warned by&nbsp;Commonwealth Games Federation&nbsp;(CGF) President Louise Martin that it will be stripped of the Games unless it meets a handful of conditions by 30 November.Worryingly, Durban 2022 is still without a Local Organising Committee, while the South African government has also not signed the host city contract or confirmed underwriting arrangements nor made any payments to the CGF.However, the CGF have said they remain committed to helping Durban if needs be, but stress they may have to search for alternatives.For South Africa and Durban, Sports and Recreation Director General Alec Moemi is working on providing the CGF with a definitive answer for the&nbsp;November&nbsp;deadline.Sam explains the possible outcomes that could be given to the CGF.&ldquo;The announcement can go either way to say we&rsquo;re ready to move forward, or we&rsquo;ve looked at our conditions and resources in the country and we feel that we should not go ahead.
