The Finance Minister on Thursday emphasised the need for a collective effort to help boost economic growth. CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says he's not preoccupied with ratings agencies as he only wants to help steer the country in the right direction. Speaking at a News24 event on Thursday, Gordhan emphasised the need for a collective effort to help boost economic growth. &quot;Can we do it as government alone? No. Do all South Africans get involved in this? Absolutely. We need a fundamental shift in mindset.&quot; Gordhan says in terms of access and quality, the country has done well. &quot;Post-World War II South Africa has probably had its most phenomenal, globally speaking, development as far as humans are concerned and their human conditions.&quot; But he says prospects must improve daily to overcome existing challenges. &quot;We have done well but there are many challenges. We need to bring the pack together and hunt together. And ensure that in the next five to 10 years we work in a determined way to ensure we overcome the challenges we are talking about.&quot; The Finance Minister yesterday delivered his medium-term budget speech in Parliament.
