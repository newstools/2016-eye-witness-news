Miller's 107-run seventh wicket partnership with Andile Phehlukwayo saw South Africa to victory. David Miller's third one-day international century saw South Africa pull off the second highest run chase ever and seal the series victory against Australia with two matches to spare. Miller revived the Proteas' run chase to help his side chase down 372 and win by four wickets. Despite a slow start, Miller dug deep and along with Andile Phehlukwayo, with whom he put on 107 off 70 balls for the seventh-wicket, took South Africa home. Miller's innings overshadowed Australia's efforts. Senior players David Warner and captain Steven Smith notched up a century each to build on an opening stand of 110 in 13 overs as they set Australia up to reach 371. Tahir took 2 wickets as did Dale Steyn, but Steyn's figures were 2/96 from 10 overs, the most expensive ODI bowling figures by a South Africa bowler. The Proteas came out firing, with Quinton De Kok making 70 and Amla scoring 45. They side was six wickets down and needing 107 runs from 80 balls when Phehlukwayo came in. Miller was unbeaten on 118 from 79, Phehlukwayo on 42 as they guided the Proteas to a series victory with 3 balls to spare. Miller was named Man of the Match.
