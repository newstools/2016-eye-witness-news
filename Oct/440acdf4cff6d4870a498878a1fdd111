The EFF suggested one percent of GDP should be allocated to universities to fund higher education. CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Parliament has suggested one percent of the countys gross domestic product (GDP) should be allocated to universities to fund higher education. This was among the funding proposals the partys Floyd Shivambu made during a debate in the National Assembly. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande today announced some fee concessions, but opposition parties say the State's plan lacks decisive action. Opposition parties in Parliament lamented what they called governments seemingly hands-off approach to the university crisis. MPs say the African National Congress has also not been seen to take clear leadership on the matter. During the debate on the tertiary fees crisis, Shivambu questioned why one percent of the GDP and an education levy on pension funds are not considered as ways to address university under funding. He believes this could help increase the more than R63 billion allocated to universities this past year. In response, Nzimande stressed that government is expanding on its fee-free education model and is considering all suggestions to amend the fees structure.
