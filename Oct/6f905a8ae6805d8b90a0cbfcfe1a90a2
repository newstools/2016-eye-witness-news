Thuli Madonsela says while she supports the call for free education, protests must be peaceful. JOHANNESBURG - Advocate Thuli Madonselasays while the call by students for free decolonised education is legitimate, it should not put their lives and studies in danger. Madonsela was addressing protesting# FeesMustFallstudents at a meeting yesterday with various stakeholders including academics and the clergy. Yesterday, students ordered vice-chancellor Adam Habib to leave the meeting at the Holy Trinity Church in Braamfontein. WATCH: Adam Habib booted from peace accord meeting Advocate Madonsela says while she supports the call for free tertiary education she says this must be done peacefully. We need to rethink the methods because we dont want any of you to be harmed and we also dont want anythingnot to complete your education. Madonsela says government and students must find a way of talking in order to find a solution to the current fees crisis. Let government and the people talk and let us find peaceful solutions. It is a legitimate quest. The former Public Protector has also warned against using police as a buffer between government and citizens. The advocate says universities cannot find a solution to the current tertiary funding crisis alone. It cant be resolved purely at the level of the university; I believe that we have to bring thatonboard. She says the conversation shouldnt be about whether fees should fall but rather how the process must happen. We do need a discussion on how, when, who and what will be the programme.
