Management held a general assembly at the Cape Town campus yesterday. CAPE TOWN - The academicprogramme at Cape Peninsula University of Technology(CPUT) remains stalled as students vow to continue protests. Management held a general assembly at the Cape Town campus yesterday. CPUT had intended to resume academic activity today, but management again finds itself in a stalemate with students because some demands have not been met. The issue of debt clearance and the removal of private security on campus appear to be sticking points. This student says debt write-off should go with free registration. Next year, I dont want to see people being sent home, like I had done in previous years. I saw my fellow friends and family go home because they were not in a position to register. Management has indicated that the concerns will be taken into consideration and will be referred to council, which is expected to meet over the weekend.
