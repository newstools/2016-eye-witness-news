JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosasays students protesting over free higher education have done a lot to prove the vibrancy and strength of South Africas democracy. Ramaphosa says although students have freedom of expression and the right to protest, he worries about a minority who have engaged in violence and the destruction of property. He says this goes against the same democracy they are fighting for. Ramaphosa says some students have in vigorous pursuit of the own rights infringed upon the rights and dignity of others. He says the manner in which government responds to the protests will say a lot about how far democracy has progressed in the country. How it navigates the line between dissent and disorder says much about the depth and resilience of a democracy in a country. Ramaphosa says he is confident there will be a sustainable solution to the challenges facing universities. Im certain an acceptable and sustainable solution will be found and South Africas democratic values will forever be enhanced. The deputy president says democracy will not flourish if the poor continue to be excluded.
