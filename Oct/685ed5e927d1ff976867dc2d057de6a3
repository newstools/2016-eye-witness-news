JOHANNESBURG - The City of Tshwane says about 70% of its buses are not operational today, due to a strike by workers affiliated to South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu). The city says it's currently unclear why workers have not reported for duty this morning. MMC for roads and transport in Tshwane, Sheila Lynn Senkubuge, has apologised to commuters for the disruptions. We re very surprised that they did not come to work today, because just yesterday we had a meeting, where we spoke to them in the presence of their representatives and they said they have no grievances.
