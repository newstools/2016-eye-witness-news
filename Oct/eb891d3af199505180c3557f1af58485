At least two councillors had to be hospitalised yesterday following a brawl in the council chambers. CAPE TOWN - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality says it will step up security at council meetings following a fight in which several councillors were injured. At least two councillors had to be hospitalised yesterday following the brawl in the council chambers in Port Elizabeth.  A Democratic Alliance (DA) member was apparently hit with a glass jug and shots were reportedly fired inside the building. The drama unfolded when African National Congress (ANC) councillors allegedly tried to disrupt a meeting.  Mayor Athol Trollip says security will have to be reviewed. “We can’t have councillors behaving like that. One of the councillors was seen with a knife. We need people who can behave themselves, but we’re not going to be cowed into submission, we’re going to do our work and deliver the services to the people.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
