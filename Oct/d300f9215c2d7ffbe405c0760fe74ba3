Teachers have reportedly been going to schools in Khayelitsha and other areas to prevent testing. CAPE TOWN The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) says it will not call off its boycott of systematic tests in the Western Cape. Educators who are reportedly affiliated to the union have been going to schools in Khayelitsha and other areas preventing tests aimed at measuring the quality of the education system from being written. The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) wrote to the union, calling for it to stop the boycott or face legal action. Sadtu deputy provincial secretary Sibongile Kwazi says the sanction is a conference-approved resolution. We intensified the boycott for this year, and its only our members who will through another provincial conference tell us if we should cease the boycott. WCED MEC Debbie Schafer says the department cannot be dictated to by the union. Their job is to ensure that they represent the interests of teachers in conditions of employment and collective bargaining, none of which apply to systemic testing. We cant allow our poor learners to be prejudiced any longer.
