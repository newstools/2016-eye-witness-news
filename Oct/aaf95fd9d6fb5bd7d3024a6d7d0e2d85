The man faces a rash of charges, including that of malicious damage to property. CAPE TOWN A fake doctor believed to be conning members of the public out of money by using abortion adverts has been caught in the Northern Suburbs. Its alleged the man has, over a number of months, been sticking abortion posters on municipal infrastructure across the city, causing R10,000 worth of damage. He would then apparently swindle money from people who enquired about his so-called services. The Citys JP Smith explains there have been several attempts to catch the man who is believed to be working with a partner. Smith adds he is facing a rash of charges, including that of malicious damage to property, as some illegal posters were even stuck on street signs. The city had a small but important victory this morning, when the Voertrekker Road Corridor Improvement District managed to nab one of the two so-called doctors who routinely put up abortion posters. These are not real doctors and most of the time it appears that they are simply taking people for a ride, conning people who are desperate and looking for help. Smith says the city will seek to recover the substantial amount of money. We have many times before tried to nab them, but they are quite wily and today one of them slipped up. The Voertrekker Road Corridor Improvement District security officers managed to nab him. The phone number [on the posters] rings on his person, and the citys law enforcement went through as well as our special investigation unit.
