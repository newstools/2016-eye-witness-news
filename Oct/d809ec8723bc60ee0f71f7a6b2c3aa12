The 40-year-old Spanish model-and-actress says she loved the ‘Thor’ star for his ‘voice’ before she set eyes on him. WASHINGTON - Chris Hemsworth’s wife Elsa Pataky says when she heard the Aussie actor’s voice she fell in love with him. The 40-year-old Spanish model-and-actress, who wed Thor star in 2010, says she was initially attracted to her future husband’s sexy deep tones during a phone call that took place before they had ever met and his handsome looks and hunky physique later sealed the deal. Atardecer y risas!! Sunsets and laughs!!😝❤️ #seeaustralia  @australia #oohaymanisland #funtimes #ocean #ejoyingthemoments #holidays A photo posted by Elsa Pataky (@elsapatakyconfidential) on Jun 16, 2016 at 4:13am PDT  Remembering what caught her attention about the 33-year-old Aussie actor, she said: “His voice is amazing! Before I met him, I heard his voice on the phone and that was what I loved. He was probably making it even deeper. He also has an amazing body, which I think is sexy.” Pondering what hooked him on her, Elsa admitted it was probably her forthright attitude and “confidence”. Speaking in the new issue of WHO magazine, Elsa said: “That’s something that is attractive in a woman. Someone who is sure of themselves. And I’m really positive about everything, too.” The couple live in Australia and have three children - daughter India, three and two-year-old twins Tristan and Sasha - together but earlier this week they were forced to deny rumours their marriage is on the rocks after a media outlet claimed Chris was looking for his “future wife”. The actor swiftly shut down the rumours by posting a picture of the couple on Instagram and captioning it: “Looking for a new wife according to (magazines) and other misleading outlets! Honey you still love me right?!” Chris and Elsa tied the knot just a few months after they started dating and he revealed he knew straight away that she was the one for him. He said: “It just made sense to both of us. There was an ease to it neither of us had had before.”
