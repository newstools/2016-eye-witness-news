The NSRI's warned beachgoers in Jeffreys Bay of increased shark presence in the vicinity of the whale carcass. CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) is warning beachgoers in the Eastern Cape of a possible shark increase. This comes after a whale carcass washed ashore, between Oyster and Jeffreys Bay earlier this week. The 15 metre mammal was pulled out to sea yesterday during high tide for &quot;natural disposal&quot;. An online statement by the institute warns that sharks were spotted in the vicinity of the carcass. NSRI's Craig Lambinon says, &quot;We are urging bathers, boaters, paddlers, sailboarders and divers to be cautious in that area.&quot;
