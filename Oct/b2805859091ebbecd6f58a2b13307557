Advocate Thuli Madonsela also dismissed allegations that shes a spy as ridiculous. JOHANNESBURG - Former Public Protector Thuli Madonselasays there needs to be a greater drive to teach the Constitution to citizens and more importantly to those in publicoffice so they know what they swear to uphold. Madonselaspoke to 702 about her seven-year termin office this morning, where she shared her history in activism andinvolvement in the liberation struggle. She also described allegations that shesa spyas ridiculous. Madonsela said it was saddening thateven government and the African National Congress(ANC)believed what she calls aconspiracy. Being called a spy was ridiculous but having the government take it seriously was saddening and bizarre. But I must speak in favour of the governing party I know. The governing party I know has never criticised me. Those who served in the trenches with me in the 80s, the Jay Naidoos and the Samson Ndous have never criticised me. Madonsela said those in the ANC who had been critical of her were new members who did not know her involvement in the struggle. A lot of the people who are critical of me, are people who just joined the ANC yesterday and that is why they dont know me. Some of them even ask me 'Where did you find this Thuli?' I should be asking them that question, 'where did they find you?'
