The NPA has announced it is holding what it calls an impromptu press conference later this morning. JOHANNESBURG - Amid reports that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head advocate Shaun Abrahams has decided to drop the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan the prosecuting authority has announced its holding what it calls an impromptu press conference at ten thirty this morning. Over the weekend it was claimed Abrahams had decided to withdraw the charges against Gordhan former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and former deputy Sars commissioner Ivan Pillay. The decision to lay the charges has led to a huge outcry from civil society amid claims that Abrahams was making decisions for political reasons. In a two line statement the NPA says simply that the national director of public prosecutions is inviting the media to an impromptu media briefing at ten thirty this morning. It says the briefing will be held at its headquarters in Silverton. But over the weekend more reports emerged that Abrahams was preparing to drop the charges against Gordhan, Magashula and Pillay. Two weeks ago, advocate Nazeer Cassim told eyewitness news that he had received a fair and proper hearing when he had made representations to Abrahams, telling him that the charges against Pillay should be dropped. But if Abrahams does withdraw this case, he's likely to be strongly criticised for having allowed the charges to be laid in the first place and could face claims he's not competent and should resign.
