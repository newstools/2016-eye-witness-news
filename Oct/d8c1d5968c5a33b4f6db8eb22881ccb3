Vytjie Mentor is joining the legal action regarding the release of the state capture report. JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Vytjie Mentor says the issue of state capture is the single greatest threat to the countrys Constitutional democracy since the end of apartheid. She has revealed several further details about her interactions with the Gupta family in an affidavit filed with the High Court in Pretoria. Mentor is joining the legal action between the Public Protector and the President regarding the release of the state capture report. She says she cooperated with former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela because of the great threat of state capture facing the country. The former MP has recounted how she was offered the position of Minister of Public Enterprises by the Guptas at their Sahara estate in 2010 on condition she cancelled South African Airways flight routes to India. This was one week before Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet. Mentor took to Facebook and heavily criticised what she believed was the Presidents attempts to intimidate witnesses in the state capture probe. She says she suspects that her Facebook account was hacked because of the adverse and damaging comments she made about Zuma.
