The institution secured the interdict from the Western Cape High Court in a bid to prevent disruptive protests on campus that have thrown academic activities into disarray. UCTs senate met earlier this week to discuss the crisis on its campus. At the meeting, officials were invited to speak openly about their fears of working amid protests and disruptions. The universitys Elijah Moholola says the interim interdict is a last ditch attempt at getting all operations back up and running. We would have preferred not to have pursued this route, but at this point we had no other alternative. UCT says its committed to addressing the grievances and demands of students if they are raised in a peaceful manner.
