Discovery announced last year that it would spend R2.1 billion to set up a retail bank. JOHANNESBURG - Insurance group Discovery has been given the regulatory go-ahead to establish a banking presence in South Africa, the company said on Tuesday, in a move that could lead to it gaining a banking licence within a year. Discovery announced last year that it would spend R2.1 billion to set up a retail bank based on the &quot;behavioural model&quot; it uses in life and health insurance to reward members for their choices. The company said on Tuesday that it had gained approval from the Registrar of Banks to establish a bank and now has a year to meet certain conditions before the registrar decides whether to grant a banking licence. Discovery did not elaborate on the conditions set by the regulator.
