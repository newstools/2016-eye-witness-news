Some state media outlets say the minister misused public money that should have gone partly to students. HARARE - Zimbabwe's Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo has been hit by corruption allegations, but one of the vice-presidents has come out in his support. It's understood that anti-corruption officials wanted to arrest the minister over allegations he diverted funds meant for students. Instead the money was partly used to buy bicycles and organise a march in support of President Robert Mugabe. Moyo has not been arrested and it is not likely that he will be. But some state media outlets have been loud in their condemnation of him. They say the minister misused public money that should have gone partly to students and apprentices in industry. The state-owned Chronicle today says officials from the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission wanted to arrest Moyo after a politburo meeting last week. But Vice-president Phelekezela Mphoko told the paper that cabinet ministers can only be arrested with Mugabe's approval, and said the attempted arrest was as bad as a mutiny.
