Imran Tahir showed a lack of respect towards the umpires when he ignored them in a spat with David Warner. CAPE TOWN &ndash; Spinner&nbsp;Imran Tahir&nbsp;has been fined 30% of his match fee for his heated exchange with Australia batsman David Warner, while South Africa were penalised for maintaining a slow over-rate in Wednesday&rsquo;s fifth ODI against Australia in Cape Town. Tahir showed a lack of respect towards the umpires when he ignored them during his verbal spat with Warner and the behaviour was deemed &ldquo;contrary to the spirit of the game&rdquo;, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said. Captain&nbsp;Faf du Plessis&nbsp;was docked 20% of his match fee and the rest of the team 10% after South Africa fell one over short of their target. Du Plessis will face a suspension if he captains South Africa to another over-rate offence within the next 12 months. Both Du Plessis and Tahir pleaded guilty and accepted the sanctions.
