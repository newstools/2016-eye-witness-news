Workers affiliated to Saccawu went on strike last week, demanding a 15% pay hike. CAPE TOWN - Operations are expected to return to normal at the Table Mountain Cableway today following a strike. The industrial action was called off after Saccawu reached an agreement with bosses. Some staffers affiliated to the union went on strike last week, demanding a 15% pay hike. Employees earning more than R10,000 will receive an 8% increase, while those paid less than that will get a 13,5% hike. Cableway managing director Wahida Parker explains: "We are very pleased and the outcome is one which I consider favourable, especially for lower earning staff. "We are entering our birthday month so we are very pleased that we can celebrate this, not only with all our staff but the local community."
