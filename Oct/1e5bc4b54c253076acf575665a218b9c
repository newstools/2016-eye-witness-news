He s currently serving a 35-year prison term for attempted murder and awaiting trial on other crimes. JOHANNESBURG &ndash;&nbsp;Eyewitness News&nbsp;understands that attempts to negotiate an exit deal for&nbsp;Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir&nbsp;have been in full swing for several months now. A letter sent by attorney Eric Bryer to the&nbsp;National Prosecution Authority&nbsp;(NPA) on Krejcir&rsquo;s behalf in which the lawyer says the Czech is willing to turn State witness and testify against top cops in exchange for extradition, was today made public. In the letter sent to the NPA earlier this month, Krejcir&rsquo;s lawyers say he is willing to plead guilty on numerous crimes and reveal details about his relationships with General Vinesh Moonoo, Richard Mdluli, Joey Mabasa and a magistrate. Attorney Bryer has been working for four months now to negotiate a deal with the NPA for Krjcir to be extradited to the Czech Republic in exchange for his explosive testimony against several top police generals and a magistrate. But Bryer&rsquo;s mandate has now been terminated and Krejcir told the South Gauteng High Court today he did not give instructions for the letter to be sent. In the correspondence, the attorney confirms to provincial director of public prosecutions Andrew Chauke that Krejcir will plead guilty to all charges if he is given concurrent ten-year jail sentences for each offence and is extradited to the Czech Republic. Krejcir also offers to undergo extensive debriefing and to testify from his home in that country where adequate security will be given. He is currently serving a 35-year prison term for attempted murder and is awaiting trial on numerous other crimes.
