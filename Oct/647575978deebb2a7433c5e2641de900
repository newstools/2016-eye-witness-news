Sport officials have robustly defended the suits worn by Team SA during the 2016 Rio Games. CAPE TOWN - Sascoc president Gideon Sam has defended, in Parliament, the controversial tracksuits worn by Team South Africa at the Rio Olympic Games.The kit drew widespread criticism from fans and athletes alike due to it being largely oversized, with last-minute tailoring required by some.Sascoc is sponsored by apparel company 361, who also dressed a number of other countries at the games.This was the main focus point in Parliament on Tuesday when Sascoc reported back to the sports committee on the both the Olympics and Paralympics, with members of Parliament (MPs) constantly referring to the &quot;ninja turtle tracksuits&quot;, which was robustly defended by Sascoc and the Department of Sport.A defiant Sam says they'll address the issues but athletes are also to blame.&quot;But as you run from the DG, you also don't want to get involved in those kind of things that are going to cost you money. I don't think it can't be addressed on the side of the sponsor.&quot;Sam says with the tightening of budgets, they need to treat their partners with care.&quot;The suitcases are packed according to the sizes that they have given us. For me, maybe we should approach the sponsor to say which cuts we prefer.&quot;CASE CLOSED ON VILJOEN Sam has told EWN Sport that he's received an apology from Sunette Viljoen's camp following the sustained attack via social media that the Olympic silver medallist launched on the body.Viljoen took to Twitter in a number of scathing attacks to highlight a lack of support in the build-up to the Rio Games, both financially and in terms of her kit that she was provided.Sam says they've moved on from the Viljoen affair.&quot;I do know that things will go on and from oversight we have to move on.&quot;
