The NPA head gave the minister until 5pm today to make submissions on fraud charges against him. JOHANNESBURG &ndash;&nbsp;Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s lawyers have told National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams that they will not be making representations to him on the fraud charges levelled against the minister.&nbsp; Abrahams yesterday&nbsp;invited Gordhan to make the submissions,&nbsp;after meeting with lawyers for former South African Revenue Services (Sars) commissioners,&nbsp;Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula. The three men have been charged for fraud in relation to Pillay&rsquo;s early retirement payout. In a letter to Abrahams, Gordhan&rsquo;s lawyers say they will not make representations to him for the reasons previously stated. Gordhan&rsquo;s lawyer Tebogo Malatji says they have decided not to make representations today. &ldquo;What we are saying is, &lsquo;Allow us to make representation prior to a decision&rsquo;, and we articulated our reasons for that. So it can&rsquo;t be that they were not aware of the fact that we contend that that opportunity was supposed to be afforded to us before the decision was firstly taken, and secondly grandstandly (sic) announced.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last week, the minister issued a statement saying he does not have faith in Abrahams to give him a fair hearing. The lawyers also invited the NPA head to withdraw the charges against Minister Gordhan. They point to the reasons outlined by civil society organisations Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation in a letter they sent to Abrahams. The National Director of Prosecutions will now consider all the representations he has received to determine whether he should proceed with the case or not.&nbsp; Abrahams also invited Hawks head&nbsp;Berning Ntlemeza&nbsp;and current Sars commissioner Tom Moyane to make representations by 5pm today.
