The university is relooking its security positioning after one of its buses was torched on Tuesday evening. JOHANNESBURG - Wits University management says they're reviewing security positioning at their campuses. This comes after one of the university's buses was torched on Tuesday evening while transporting students to the education campus. The university says it has temporarily stopped the bus service, so it can allow itself to plan and implement accordingly. The university says students who were on the bus and those who heard about the incident are still shocked, however, they still want to use the service. No one was injured from the arson attack and police are still investigating. Wits University says it will start deploying security guards inside buses and at bus stops to prevent protesters from torching its vehicles. The university says it temporarily stopped the bus service to allow for time to plan a security strategy to protect students who depend on the mode of transport. The university Shirona Patel said, &quot;Weve asked security guards to check for student cards for every person boarding the bus; so there are security guards at every bus stop, in the buses as well as cars escorting the buses.&quot; Patel says they're not sure whether Wits students took part in the arson attacks. CALLS FOR GOVT INTERVENTION At the same time, Wits management says it hopes Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan can offer financial relief to students in his mid-term budget today. The university says it's doing everything possible to save the academic year and now needs intervention from government. University spokesperson Shirona Patel said, &quot; We are looking forward to the minister's speech today, with the hope that there will be something fruitful for the students.&quot; Classes continued smoothly this morning without protests at the university, but a group of students with placards started to assemble in front of the Solomon Mahlangu Hall.
