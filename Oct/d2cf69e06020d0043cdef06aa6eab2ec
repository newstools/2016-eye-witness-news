About 220 workers went on strike in August, demanding an R8,500 minimum wage. CAPE TOWN - The Commercial Stevedoring Agricultural and Allied Workers' Union has vowed that its members will continue a month-long strike against Robertson Winery until demands are met. About 220 workers went on strike in August, demanding an R8,500 minimum wage. The union is expected to meet with the employer next week to begin mediation under the auspices of the CCMA. The union's Deneco Dube says the company's negotiating in slave wages. "Workers want to negotiate in rand, with money, as they're buying in rand and not percentages." Robertson is currently proposing a minimum wage just over R4,000 a month.
