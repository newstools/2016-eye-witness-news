Obed Dube developed the system after he saw his brother struggling. JOHANNESBURG A local entrepreneur has designed a self-marking tool to help matriculants prepare for their final exams. The online program Study Gap was created by Obed Dube amid the frustration built-up from seeing his younger brother struggle to find, download and print past exam papers - with no one to mark and correct his answers. After extensive research on some of the study methods used to increase academic performance among students, Dube says he presented a series of case studies to the University of South Africa to provide the electronic self-marking exam papers. Unisa actually loved it and I was chosen to present the research at a conference, so from there I built a website, portal of a cloud and I have been working with educators to turn past exam papers into self-marking exam papers. So how it works is a student would write an exam online from a past paper and once he completes it, he submits it and the paper is marked on the spot. Explaining its effectiveness, he says So he is able to identify the problem areas, and then above that, every incorrect answer comes with a study task to help him overcome the problem areas. He says the objective of the study task is to enable students to problem solve and better grasp the question at hand. The program eventually gained momentum through word of mouth, with some of his brothers friends requesting access to the platform. Over 500 students are registered on the system. There are currently five subjects on the site, including maths and maths literacy. The study aid has been made available to both private and public school pupils. Screengrab of the study gap website
