The ANCWL has condemned what it calls police brutality during protests at South African universities. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) has called on police officers manning universities to be cautious saying South Africa cannot afford another Marikana. The league was reacting to the shooting at Wits University on Thursday, in which student leader Shaeera Kalla was struck 13 times by rubber bullets, when police tried to disperse protesters. Claims that police used excessive force against students will now be the subject of an investigation by Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). The ANCWL has condemned what it calls police brutality during the protests at South African universities. The league's Meokgo Matuba said, We dont want to see another Marikana and they [police] must act within the prescripts of the law. The league says while it calls on police officers restoring order at universities to stop violent attacks--students must also protest peacefully without violence and destruction of property.
