Analysts say government's withdrawal from the ICC is likely to prompt other African countries to follow suit. Masutha announced South Africa's withdrawal from the ICC just a week after Burundi confirmed its plans to pull out. Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza has been accused of torturing and murdering his political opponents, claims he denies. South Africa's announcement is now expected to prompt other African countries, who have accused the tribunal of a bias against the continent, to announce their own plans to withdraw. Its also likely to bring further controversy for President Jacob Zuma, who is facing protests over high university fees and scandal over his close relationship with the Gupta brothers, who allegedly had a hand in the appointment of cabinet minister. In its one-page notice of withdrawal delivered to the United Nations in New York, South Africa argues that the court's rulings were sometimes &quot;incompatible&quot; with the &quot;peaceful resolution of conflicts&quot;.
