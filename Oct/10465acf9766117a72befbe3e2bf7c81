BENGALURU - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said he is still learning to adapt to the demands of English football as he seeks to end his club's five-game winless run against rivals Manchester United in the League Cup on Wednesday.City made a blistering start to the campaign, winning their first 10 games in all competitions, but momentum has been stalled in recent weeks, and Sunday's 1-1 draw against Southampton marked the fifth consecutive game without a victory.Guardiola's side are also trailing Barcelona by five points in their Champions League group after three games.&quot;Our last few games have been tough,&quot; Guardiola told British media. &quot;If you are winning a game 3-0 in the last 15 or 20 minutes you can have more control and it gets a little easier.&quot;But we were playing 10 against 11 against Barcelona, it's physical and tough in the Champions League.&quot;After that there was the game against Southampton, when we made a mistake to go behind. Three days after Manchester United it is West Brom, then Barcelona and they are so important as well,&quot; he said.&quot;I am still learning about football in this country.&quot;Guardiola has told his players not to lose faith in his high-risk, high-reward style of football, but has said he needs time to assess his side.&quot;Even when we were winning 10 games in a row I felt we had to make a lot of effort to win those games. You cannot win any game here without spending a lot of energy,&quot; he added.&quot;I am still learning how the team reacts to winning and not winning, to playing at home after a Champions League game, and I am pretty sure I need time.&quot;City, still top of the league on goal difference ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool, travel to face West Bromwich Albion in the league on Saturday.
