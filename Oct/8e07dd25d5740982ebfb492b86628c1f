The decision follows a high courts ruling that the advocates be removed from the roll. JOHANNESBURG - < a href="http://ewn.co.z a/Topic/President-J acob-Zum a">President J acob Zum a</a>h as given notice of his intention to suspend Deputy N ation al Directors of Public Prosecutions < a href="http://ewn.co.z a/Topic/Advoc ate-Nomgcobo-Jib a">Nomgcobo Jib a</a> and Lawrence Mrwebi, pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. The two were found by the High Court in Pretoria to not be fit and proper to be advocates after being strongly criticised by judges for their conduct in cases relating to former police intelligence head Richard Mdluli. The court also found that Jiba had flouted every rule in the fight against crime while Mrwebi had lied to a colleague. President Zumas spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga says hes' taking this action as a result of this latest high court judgment. The Presidents decision follows that of the North Gauteng High Court which ordered that the two of them should be removed from the roll of advocates. In that ruling the court found Jiba had done everything she could to protect Mdluli and that her conduct displayed an ulterior motive. Judge Francis Legodi also found that Mrwebi had no excuse for his lies. The President has requested the two advocates provide him with reasons as to why they cannot be suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry into their fitness to hold office. After hearing the two advocates, the President will then take a decision whether or not to suspend them. President Zuma has in a letter informed Jiba and Mrwebi of his decision. Ngqulunga said, Hopefully they are going to give him reasons pretty soon. Basically, they have to tell him why they shouldnt be suspended and the inquiry while the is underway. In its judgment, the High Court in Pretoria said that Mrwebi had betrayed his oath of office and that he had given evidence that was patently dishonest.
