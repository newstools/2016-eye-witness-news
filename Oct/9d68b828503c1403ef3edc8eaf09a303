The Council of Geoscience earlier confirmed a 3.5 magnitude tremor struck the Swartberg region earlier today. Seismologists say the affected areas include Prince Albert and Oudtshoorn. Steve Mouton, a guide at the Caves, says: "The caves are actually a safe environment to be in if there's an earthquake, considering the tremors run along the surface and we'd be underneath the surface. As a precaution we'll shut it down to go and check if anything has happened on the inside."
