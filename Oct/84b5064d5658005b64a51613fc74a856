At least R212 million will be added to the agriculture support grant to provide drought relief. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape farmers have welcomed a R212 million addition to the agriculture support grant to provide drought relief. In his mini-budget statement yesterday, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced this drought relief addition will be indirectly administered on behalf of the provinces by the Agriculture Department. To fund the provision of emergency water supplies to drought-affected communities, more than R50 million has also been added to the water services infrastructure grant. AgriSA's Christo van de Rheede says: &quot;Pravin Gordhan has constructed a very realistic budget and this will help South Africa to get direction. It is now up to the various state departments and ministers to execute. It is one thing to make money available, we want to know who is going to benefit and what processes will follow.&quot;
