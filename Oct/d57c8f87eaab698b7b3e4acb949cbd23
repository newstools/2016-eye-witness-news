Noakes says his legal team is considering taking steps against the council, but nothing has yet been decided. CAPE TOWN - Banting expert Tim Noakes says he will not be distracted from winning his unprofessional conduct case before the Health Professions Council of South Africa next year. On Friday, the council released an inaccurate statement saying Noakes has been found guilty by the Professional Conduct Committee. They apologised and withdrew the statement hours later. But Noakes says the damage has already been done as the factually incorrect statement has been widely shared. He says his legal team is considering taking further steps against the council, but nothing has yet been decided. &quot;All we're interested in is the truth. This other stuff is just not part of the issue. We want to win this case and we're going to keep focusing on that, what else happens is extraneous to that.&quot; Noakes says he was alarmed when the statement was released on Friday. &quot;I think one of the keys is how widespread the message went, and we know that in the Transvaal it was the number one trend on Twitter. So that's how many people saw this misinformation, and that obviously alarming for us.&quot; The hearing relating to a tweet Noakes sent to a mother about weaning her baby on a low carb/high fat diet resumes in April 2017. Closing arguments will then be heard and a verdict will be given.
