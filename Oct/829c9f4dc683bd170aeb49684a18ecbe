The two cousins are accused of rape and murder of 19-year-old Sinoxolo Mafevuka in March this year. CAPE TOWN - The pre-trial hearing of two men accused of the murder and rape of Sinoxolo Mafevuka in Khayelitsha is scheduled for the Western Cape High Court today. The cousins have been in police custody since they were denied bail in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court two months ago. Mafevuka's body was found in a communal toilet close to her home in March. The two cousins accused of the rape and murder of 19-year-old Sinoxolo will most likely be represented by a Legal Aid attorney.  Their former lawyer Thabo Nogemane, who represented them during proceedings in the Khayelitsha Magistrate Court, said the men could not afford his services any longer. The two accused have been in Pollsmoor Prison since their arrest in March. The State has said it intends on calling 33 witnesses, including a man who says he saw the accused drag Mafevuka to the toilets on the night of her disappearance in March. Previously the prosecution said many witnesses were reluctant to testify because they were scared of the accusedâ€™s family. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
