The students were granted bail of R3,000 each on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - The case against 12 Cape Peninsula University of Technology(CPUT) students has been postponed to mid-December. The protesters were granted bail of R3,000 each yesterday. The students have been charged with public violence, while three of them face an additional charge of contravening a high court order. Student leader Siphelele Maqude says: The amount of bail is insane because a student is expected to pay an amount of R3,000 for bail. It is shocking for the magistrate to give this amount for bail to students who were in their rooms. The 12 accused will be accommodated at a building belonging to the Methodist Church in Belhar for the duration of the case.
