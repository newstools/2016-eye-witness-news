Since joining the ICC she's been at pains to deny that the body's singling out African human rights violators. JOHANNESBURG - International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has not commented on her native Gambia joining Burundi and South Africa in quitting the international tribunal. However, her predecessor Luis Moreno Ocampo is adamant African leaders are covering up war crimes. Bensouda is a former justice minister in Gambia. Since becoming prosecutor of the ICC, she has been at pains to deny that the 14-year-old body is singling out African human rights violators for attention. However, Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh insists this exactly what has happened. His Information Minister Sheriff Bojang asks why former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was not indicted over the Iraq war. Gambia has been trying to get the European Union prosecuted for the deaths of Africans trying to reach its shores.
