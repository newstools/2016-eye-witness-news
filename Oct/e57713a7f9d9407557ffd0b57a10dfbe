So proud to represent my country & continent right now. 🌍💙🌍 A photo posted by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Sep 25, 2016 at 9:44am PDT Thusi, who is also known as 'Mamma Panther', says her role is also an opportunity to showcase Africa's talent. "There's an intense sense of pride, I need to represent not just the whole country but the continent. The value I provide here is the type that people will think is in Africa." But it's not all work and no play for Mama Panther, who has been bonding with her co-star Priyanka Chopra over Bollywood movies.  A video posted by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Sep 25, 2016 at 9:16pm PDT Chopra has made a number of Indian movies in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban where Thusi grew up. "I've been talking to Pearl about the movies and the meaning of the songs she used to know. She grew up in an Indian school and we've bonded on that." Chopra says they share another commonality. "We spend evenings together about being two girls from completely different countries and having to live in America."  Career #gains are also important. I'll be flexing on Sunday on ABC (I still can't believe this is real) @abcnetwork . Africa- we're on Monday on @vuzutv .😘😘😘 . So watch if you're not hating.

Either way- I'm flexing my blessing from God. #flexnoflex #blessed #Quantico #Quan2co #amidreaming #nah #imliving #imalotmate #worlddomination #blackgirlmagic #abc #myafricandream #priyankachopra A photo posted by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Sep 25, 2016 at 4:41am PDT
