A witness says Christopher Panayiotou paid him to get rid of a phone used to orchestrate his wifes murder. CAPE TOWN - The defence for Christopher Panayiotou has tested the credibility of a witness who claims the accused paid him to get rid of a phone allegedly used to orchestrate his wifes murder. The Port Elizabeth businessman is accused of hiring men to kill Jayde Panayiotou in April last year. Christopher Panayiotou and two others are on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Mawonga Ndedwa worked as a handyman at the Panayiotou's OK Grocer store. Today he testified Christopher Panayiotou paid him R1,000 to get rid of his cellphone, which he alleges was used to call alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni. Siyoni was a bouncer at a Panayiotous club, who has turned State witness. #PanayiotouTrial Defence: you say you deliberately stole a bottle of whisky from these people but you wouldn&#39;t leave while it was busy?

SF The defence argued Ndedwa never planned to go to the police with the phone and wanted to use it to extort R150,000 out of the Panayiotous when he was fired for stealing whiskey earlier this year. According to Ndedwa he deliberately got fired because he planned to go to police with the information about the phone. He told the court the accused paid him to get rid of his SIM card and cellphone two weeks before Jayde Panayiotou's disappearance. #PanayiotouTrial Defence: I&#39;m trying to show court what a dishonest witness you are.
