Those who are still alive will also be eligible to have their criminal records wiped clean. LONDON - Government says thousands of men who were convicted under the now-abolished British laws against homosexualitywillreceive posthumous pardons. Those who are still alivewill alsobe eligible to have their criminal records wiped clean. The pardons will apply to men convicted ofconsensual same-sexrelations before homosexuality was decriminalised several decades ago. Alan Turing, the man who helped crack the Nazi codes, was convicted of gross indecency with another man in 1952. He was later chemically castrated and took his own life two years later. His pardon, almost 60 years on, led to calls for a wider forgiveness for other deceased who were convicted of acts no longer deemed to be criminal. Now they will receive an automatic pardon in England and Wales with judiciary in Scotland and Northern Ireland likely to follow suit.
