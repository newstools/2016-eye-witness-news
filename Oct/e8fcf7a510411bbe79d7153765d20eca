At least 10 students were arrested yesterday for their alleged involvement in the vandalism. JOHANNESBURG - Rhodes University vice-chancellor Sizwe Mabizela says he is concerned that any victory for affordable tertiary education will be in vain if the destruction of public property continues. Several buildings at the institution were damaged this week by protesting students. At least 10 students were arrested yesterday for their alleged involvement in the vandalism. Mabizela visited them at the Grahamstown police station. He says while he sympathised with their cause, he cautioned against violence. "Let us not destroy what we have because we have always to be very vigilant about what is called a pyrrhic victory, a victory which is achieved at such a cost that it is not a victory worth celebrating." Classes are continuing at Rhodes and students are expected to sit for exams in two weeks.
