Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson says Eskom will go to the global markets to raise the money needed. CAPE TOWN - Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson says Eskom will fund the government's nuclear build programme off its own balance sheet. With a reported price tag of around R1 trillion, the plans to build 9,600MW of nuclear power have been highly controversial and shrouded in secrecy. Joemat-Pettersson and senior Department of Energy officials are briefing Parliament's energy oversight committee. She says Eskom will find the money for the nuclear programme in the same way that it funded the building of Medupi and Kusile power stations. The minister says the money to fund the government's ambitious nuclear energy expansion plans will not come from Treasury. "This programme is not going to be funded by the fiscus but off the balance sheet of our entities." She says Eskom will go to global markets to raise the money needed. This means Eskom will be in the driving seat when it comes to the procurement process, while the Department of Energy will play a coordinating role. The minister was due to issue a request for proposals to kick start the nuclear build programme at the end of September.
