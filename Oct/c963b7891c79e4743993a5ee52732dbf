The 49-year-old actress' website was targeted by hackers in August. LOS ANGELES - Leslie Jones insists she wasn't embarrassed when her nude photos were hacked because she isn't particularly shy. The 49-year-old actress' website, JustLeslie.com, was targeted in August, with her intimate pictures and personal information posted on the site, but she insists she wasn't too upset as she isn't particularly "shy" and is very "comfortable" who she is. Speaking about hacking and cybersecurity during a Weekend Update segment of Saturday Night Live - in which she played herself - she said: "I was recently hacked myself. "All they did was release some nude pics of me which is nothing because, I don't know if y'all know this about me, but I ain't shy. "I am very comfortable with who I am. I am an open book. I keep my porn in a folder labeled 'porn.' If you wanna see Leslie Jones naked, just ask. "What I'm trying to say is if you want to hurt anybody these days, you're going to have to way more than leak their nudes or call them names. You can't embarrass me more than I've embarrassed myself." And despite briefly leaving Twitter this summer after being targeted by trolls, the Ghostbusters actress insists the online commenters don't bother her. She said: "Do you think some words on the internet can hurt me? "I once had a crazy bitch try to beat me with a shovel at a bus stop because I took her spot on the bench. Now that's a troll! Real trolls ain't tappin' on keyboards; they swingin' shovels." Leslie went on to joke that if she was better with computers, she'd either hack into Tinder so potential boyfriends would only have her as an option to swipe, or take her skills even further. She joked: "Matter of fact, if I was that good at computers I would build myself a man, a perfect masculine robot man. "Full of perfect robots and perfect penises."
