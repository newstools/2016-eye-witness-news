Zain Small followed a white Jaguar heading in the wrong direction on the N1. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Townis to honour a truck driver who assisted in arresting an errant motorist. Zain Small followed the white Jaguar as it was heading in the wrong direction on the N1. Small attempted to stop the vehicle and also warned oncoming traffic by flashing his headlights. The city's JP Smith said: After having looked at the video tape, we are convinced that were it not for the intervention of Mr Small we would have had a horrible accident or a pile up. In the end it took an enormous effort for him to bring this driver to halt, by which time traffic officers arrived on the scene. But he really is a hero and his actions certainly prevented the loss of life.
