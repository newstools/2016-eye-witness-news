The health department has since launched an investigation with the ombudsman about the matter. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Health Department says there are no medical files for the 37th patient who's been reported dead after being transferred from the Life Esidimeni Health Care Centre. Nombulelo Mthembu was one of 1,300 patients transferred from the centre in June to other facilities around the province without her family's consent. The health department has since launched an investigation with the ombudsman about the matter. The department's Richard Lebethe says: "She didn't come in with records. Remember, like I said, we've been dealing with the health ombudsman. We've been taking files from Life Esidimeni one by one as they give them to us."
