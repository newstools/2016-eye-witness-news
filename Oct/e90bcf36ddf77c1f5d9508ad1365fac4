New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says her office will no longer accept foreign funding. JOHANNESBURG Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebanesays there are risks involved when it comes to utilising donor funding. Under former Public ProtectorThuli Madonsela the office had received $500,000 from the United State Agency for International Development and Mkhwebane says this threatens the independence of the Public Protector. She says they will no longer be accepting foreign donor funds. We have requested Parliament to fund this institution, and we have indicated how much additional funding we have. From the deliberations yesterday, it was clear that they would be funding us. Mkhwebane says they will also do away with consultants, suspend international travel and focus on cost cutting during her term. But she has denied there's competition between her and Madonsela, saying its unfair to compare her to her predecessor for matters she hasnt even dealt with yet. Mkhwebane insists that her plans for her office, as well as the fact that she has raised some issues about low staff morale at the Public Protector, are not an attack on Madonsela. She has run her race and I will do my part. To put the record straight, we are not in competition.
