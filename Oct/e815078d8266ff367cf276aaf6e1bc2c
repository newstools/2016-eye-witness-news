Itll cost $100,000 to be a part of the annual dinner party where Grace Mugabe is the guest of honour. JOHANNESBURG Zimbabwes President Robert Mugabesparty is advertising tables for up to $100,000 at a dinner where First Lady Grace Mugabe will be the guest of honour. The country may be in the throes of a cash crisis, but Zanu-PFsays its pushing ahead with fund-raising activities anyway. This is an annual event to raise funds for the ruling partys December conference. Adverts published in the press today say that the most expensive tables will go for $100,000 each. Therell be some questions over whether the money wouldn't be better spent on providing drugs in some hospitals or on food for those hit by drought. Former vice president Joice Mujuru was guest of honour at a similar event two years ago which raised a million dollars for the congress, but she was then sacked.
