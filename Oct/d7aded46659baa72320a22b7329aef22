Public Protector Mkhwebane indicated she will not oppose the president's bid to halt the reports's release. JOHANNESBURG - Advocate Thuli Madonsela says she is not surprised by her successor Busisiwe Mkhwebane's decision not to oppose President Jacob Zuma's application to block the release of the state capture report. Madonsela was speaking on the sidelines of the Association for Certified Fraud Examiners Gala dinner held in Sandton last night, where she received an honorary award. Madonsela says if she was the new Public Protector, she probably would have also chosen not to oppose the president's application. &quot;She didn't get the opportunity to meet with me and get a sense of my thinking, but even if she had gotten my thinking, she has a right to make her own decision.&quot; The state capture report, which was due to be released on Madonsela's last day in office, is now under lock and key, pending legal action by Zuma. On Friday, Mkhwebane indicated that she will not oppose the president's attempt to halt the release of the report. Meanwhile, Madonsela says she is not fazed by the African National Congress Youth League's calls for her to be investigated, as the league is on the side of looting. &quot;The ANC Youth League has decided that it's going to be on the side of looting. Every time I investigate something that suggests state funds have been looted, the ANCYL has always said I shouldn't do that, so nothing fazes me.&quot; The youth league had previously called Madonsela a CIA spy.
