Equal Education, which is assisting the schoolchildren, claims issues have been raised as far back as April. CAPE TOWN Lobby group Equal Education says hundreds of pupils in poor communities are growing increasingly frustrated by what it calls a lack of accountability from the Western Cape government. Pupils from some schools held protests in Strand, Mowbray, Khayelitsha and Gugulethu last week blocking roads. They are demanding the provincial Education Department address their concerns after a social audit found inadequate infrastructure, a lack of proper sanitation and safety concerns in many schools. Equal Education, which is assisting the schoolchildren, claims issues have been raised as far back as April. The organisation's Nishal Robb says the provincial government has instead sought to discredit the audit. Claiming that learners have made this information up but we have had the methodology and its been checked by experts and has been confirmed. Robb adds this has left pupils frustrated. The fact that learners are willing to shut down their school for an entire day is not frivolous. Education MEC Debbie Schafer says it takes longer to go through the 100-page document and a response will likely come on Monday.
