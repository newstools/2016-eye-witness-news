A report says a Gupta-linked company knew of the axing of Nhlanhla Nene two months before it happened. JOHANNESBURG Shocking claims of state capture that have been made public for the first time, reportedly reveal how a Gupta-linked company knew of the axing of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, two months before it happened and scored millions from state owned companies for work it never carried out. The Sunday Times is reporting that a whistleblower has detailed how Trillian CEO Eric Wood briefed some of the company's top executives about Nene's sacking during a meeting at its Melrose Arch offices in October last year. The whistleblower's claims are contained in an affidavit submitted to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and forms part of her state capture report. The report was due to be released last week but is now being kept under lock and key pending legal action by President Jacob Zuma. New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkwebane indicated on Friday that she would not oppose the president's attempt to block the release of the report.
