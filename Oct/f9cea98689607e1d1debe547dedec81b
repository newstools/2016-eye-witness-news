Protea Coin investigator says the user could not be identified because the footage was of a poor quality. PORT ELIZABETH - A bank investigator has testified how a problematic ATM camera nearly derailed the investigation into the kidnapping and murder of Jayde Panayiotou. The teacher disappeared from outside her Port Elizabethhome and was later found murdered on the outskirts of Uitenhage last April. Her husband Christopheris accused of hiring men to kill her. An investigator for Protea Coin, contracted to Nedbank, told the court that police contacted him on the day of Panayiotou's disappearance to help trace her. Following movement in Panayiotous account, Streicher Botha visited three ATMs in Kwanobuhle outside Uitenhage to view footage. Initially a screenshot of a person using an ATM was distributed to police and media. It was later established that the person in the photo did not withdraw money from Panayiotous account. The suspicious transaction had taken place at a different ATM, but the person could not be identified because the footage was of a poor quality.
