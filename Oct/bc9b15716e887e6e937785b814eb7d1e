Coach Ephraim Mashaba was unhappy with his side's first half performance. JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana continued their unbeaten streak against Ghana, in friendly matches, when they rescued a draw at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban last night.The South African's looked below par in the first half, struggling to string together meaningful passes to attack the Ghanaian final third with purpose and made several amateur mistakes in dangerous parts of the field.The home side was punished late in the first half when debutant Isaac Nhlapo brought down Harrison Afful in the box with a lunging challenge, resulting in Mubarak Wakaso burying the ball past another debutant, Brighton Mhlongo in goal.Coach Shakes Mashaba was clearly very unimpressed with Nhlapo's costly blunder and decided to remove him from the game and replace him with Ramahlwe Mphahlele for the half-time whistle.Bafana looked much better in the second half, and played with a great deal of direction, finding spaces and opportunities a lot more.Just six minutes into the second period, Ayanda Patosi produced a stunner of a goal to draw Mashaba's charges level, firing a curling shot into the back of the net, from just inside the 18-yard box.That rejuvenation from South Africa prompted Ghana coach Avram Grant to throw on some of his more experienced campaigners who he'd decided to rest for the match, but not even they could not break the hosts down.Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba was unhappy with his team's first half performance, admitting the first half was far from ideal.&quot;As you can see we've given the players a chance who have not been playing for Bafana for a long time. It wasn't a good first half, but I wouldn't say it was a flop because the Ghanaians played good football. They really challenged us. In the second half we made some changes and things changed for the better.&quot;The national team will be in action on 12 November in the second World Cup qualifier against Senegal.
