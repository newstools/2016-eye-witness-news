Students will soon be advised about assessment times and venues. CAPE TOWN - The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has decided to suspend face-to-face lectures for the rest of the year. CPUTs senate executive yesterday held an urgent meeting to consider its options. The institution says its faculties are in a position to start prepping for exams and set credible assessments, depending on the extent of completion. Students will soon be advised about assessment times and venues. Meanwhile, early this morning a fire was started at CPUTs Wellington campus. An investigation is underway to determine whether the fire in a hall is linked to student protests.
