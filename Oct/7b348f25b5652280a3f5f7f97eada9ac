As of Monday Wits facilities will be opened to staff who will begin their work to make up for lost time. JOHANNESBURG - Wits University management has announced it will resume lectures on Tuesday following student protests at the university. After analysing the results of a student and staff poll Wits has decided to resume its academic programme this week. Staff members are expected to return to campuses tomorrow. Student protests flared up at universities across the country following Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande's announcement that universities would set 2017 fee increases within an eight percent cap. The university says additional security will remain in place until students can give assurance that they will refrain from disruptive behaviour. The university has listened to the calls of more than 18,000 staff and students who have called for academic activity to resume this week. As of tomorrow campus facilities will be opened to staff who will begin their work to make up for lost academic time. The institution says it has lost too much time on its academic programme and would be putting the lives of thousands at risk if it didn't reopen soon. A tight security presence is expected to be maintained with police being asked to remain around the university's perimeter. LISTEN: Some Wits students vote for university to reopen on Monday.

Earlier this week, an opinion poll has showed that more than 16,000 students want lectures to resume.
