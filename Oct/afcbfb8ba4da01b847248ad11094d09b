The acting Ipid head allegedly started the process to move McBride 'sympathisers' out of the head office. PRETORIA- Eyewitness News understandsthat Independent Police Investigative Directoratehead Robert McBridehas halted restructuring initiated by acting head Israel Kgamanyane. McBride and several other senior officials were suspended for nearly two years but returned to work last week. The group was accused of altering the report into the rendition of five Zimbabweans in 2010, allegedly to clear implicated senior Hawks officials. Last month, the Constitutional Court ruledthat Police Minister Nathi Nhleko's decision to suspend McBride was unlawful and set it aside. The court gave the minister 30 days to initiate disciplinary proceedings through Parliament, but that deadline expired last week and allowed for McBride to return to work. It is understood that McBride is working to reverse 18 months of restructuring, including staff deployments and unfair disciplinary proceedings against employees. McBride is also seeking legal advice on the dismissal of two senior investigators, who were fired for their involvement in the rendition matter. Its alleged Kgamanyane started the process to move those perceived as being sympathetic to McBride out of the head office. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini confirmed that McBride was seeking legal advice, adding that he was committed to doing everything within the confines of the law and Constitution.
