Life Esidimeni has been in the spotlight following the recent deaths of 37 psychiatric patients. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu says she's asked the health ombudsman to investigate all fatalities at the Life Healthcare Esidimeni Centre during its contract with the department. The facility has been in the spotlight following the deaths of 37 patients after being transferred to NGOs across the province. It later emerged that 97 others died while in the care of the private institution over the last three years. Life Esidimeni's doctor Nilesh Patel says, on average, it lost 8.25 patients per month across its facilities in Gauteng between October 2013 and September 2015. "Also to remember that patients of severe and chronic mental conditions have chance of 10 to 25 years reduction in life expectancy." He has sent condolences to the families of the 37 psychiatric patients, who died after being transferred from Esidimeni earlier this year. Gauteng health spokesperson, Steve Mabona, says the deaths that occurred at Life Esidimeni will also be investigated. "We've requested the health ombudsman to laso look at the five years that these Life Esidimeni patients were taken care of there." Health ombudsman, Malegapuru Makgoba, has confirmed that his investigation has started.
