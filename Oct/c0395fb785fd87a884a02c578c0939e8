UCT has secured an interdict to prevent disruptions while Wits plans to beef up security for its exams. CAPE TOWN - The University of Cape Town says an interim interdict is a last ditch attempt at getting operations back up and running. The institution secured the interdict from the Western Cape High Court earlier this week. This was done to try and prevent disruptive protests on campus that have thrown academic activities into disarray. UCT's Elijah Moholola says they're committed to successfully completing the academic year. &quot;We are deeply concerned for the safety of staff and students alike, including protesters. We are extremely worried that the violence and the unlawfulness that some of the protesters are engaging in, present a real risk.&quot; In Johannesburg, Wits University says it is already compiling security plans to make sure the exam period is uninterrupted. Wits says there are three more days before the short break begins, enough time for them to plan sufficiently for the exams. Classes at the university have continued this week despite protests in nearby Braamfontein by students demanding free education. With just under six days to go before the end of year exams begin, Wits says it is discussing different security plans to ensure exams go smoothly. The university's Shirona Patel says they will not let the students' efforts for the entire year go to waste. &quot;Exams run from the 3rd to the 30th of November and we have got certain security plans in place for the exams, we will release further details next week.&quot; The institution will be closing for a short break from Friday until Tuesday when the month-long exams begin. Meanwhile at Rhodes University, two exam venues and a tennis club were torched yesterday afternoon.
