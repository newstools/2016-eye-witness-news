Management says lectures are expected to resume tomorrow. CAPE TOWN - About 500 protesters are gathered at the entrance to the Cape Peninsula University of Technology's (CPUT) Bellville campus. Academic activities were suspended today. It's unclear when operations will resume after classes were suspended due to student protests. CPUT's spokesperson Lauren Kansley says, "Classes remain suspended today and staff, apart from those performing essential duties, have also been asked not to report for duty. Classes are expected to resume tomorrow and all staff will also return to work. There were no major incidents reported over the weekend, however, we are monitoring a group of about 500 students at the Bellville campus." The institution is meant to start with final exams in less than a month's time. The institution's vice-chancellor Prins Nevhutalu says the executive is committed to ensuring the academic year continues. It's understood a meeting between management and students has been planned for today.
