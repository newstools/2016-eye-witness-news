The SABC board has since been rendered unable to operate while an inquiry into its fitness is being finalised. JOHANNESBURG The Save Our SABC (SOS) Coalition has welcomed the latest SABC board member's resignation and its calling on chairperson Mbulayeni Maguvhe to follow suit. The Presidency confirmed yesterday that it's received and accepted Leah Khumalo's notice with immediate effect. Her resignation follows those of Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso who quit earlier this month during a presentation to Parliament's Portfolio Committee. The SABC board has since been rendered unable to operate while an inquiry into its fitness is being finalised. The coalition's Sekoatlane Phamodi said, We welcome this resignation and hope that Maguvhe will do the same after his defiant press briefing saying he would not resign from the SABC board.
