The institution says about 500 law students were affected after protesting students disrupted exams. JOHANNESBURG Wits University has confirmed at least four students were arrested this afternoon after attempting to disrupt classes and tests at its Braamfontein and Park Town campuses. The institution says about 500 law students were affected after protesting students disrupted exams using fire crackers. Wits University has been hit by Fees Must Fall protests for nearly a month now. Yesterday student leader Shaeera Kalla was struck by 13 rubber bullets when police tried to disperse demonstrators who were trying to access the great hall. Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel says, Many rights of students who were in lecture theatres, who were writing tests and exams, were violated; as well as observations that are put forward in the court order - its for that reason that the university will be taking this matter further.
