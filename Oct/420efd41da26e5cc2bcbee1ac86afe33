Leigh-Ann Naidoo has posted a YouTube video claiming to have been kidnapped by Israeli government forces. JOHANNESBURG - A South African woman has made a plea for help, saying she was kidnapped when the Israeli government intercepted a boat carrying pro-Palestinian female activists to Gaza. Leigh-Ann Naidoo, a volleyball champion and human rights activist, was on board with several women from all over the world to challenge the Israeli blockade on Gaza. In a video posted on YouTube, Naidoo says if this video is published they have been intercepted and kidnapped by Israeli occupation forces.  Attorney Ziyaad Patel, who is representing the group, says they've made contact with the Department of International Relations and others to try secure their release. "We have not yet received an official response from Dirco, but we are receiving some types of response on social media that there has been communication with Israeli authorities." In a diary entry published online, Naidoo says they will either be moved to a prison or deported while in a detention centre, but hopes that their mission will highlight the unlawful blockade of Palestine.
