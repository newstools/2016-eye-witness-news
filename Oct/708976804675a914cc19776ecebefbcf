Jacob Zuma says he needs more time to respond to an application filed by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma wants to postpone the court hearing on the former public protector's state capture report, saying he needs more time to respond to the application filed this week by former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor. The case is due to be heard on Tuesday on an urgent basis, with the Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters, United Democratic Movement and Congress of the People opposing Zuma's application to stop the release of the report, following Thuli Madonsela's investigation into the President's relationship with the controversial Gupta family.President Zuma applied for an urgent court interdict to stop the release of the state capture report the day before it was due to be released by former Madonsela.Zuma maintains he didn't have enough time to answer questions from Madonsela or interview the witnesses who supplied her with evidence.This week, Mentor filed an affidavit asking to be listed as a respondent in the case; in it, she confirms that the Gupta family had offered her a cabinet post and claims Zuma was present at the meeting.Now in a letter sent by the President's lawyers, Zuma s team says it will be opposing Mentor s application, meaning more affidavits need to be exchanged.He says this means the matter will not be ready for a hearing on Tuesday.
