JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congre s s(ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Vytjie Mentor says she believes witnesses who were interviewed as part of the Public Protectors state capture probe are being intimidated by the President. She has revealed several further details about her interactions with the Gupta fam ily in an affidavit filed with the High Court in Pretoria. Mentor is joining the legal action between the Public Protector and the President regarding the release of the state capture report. The former MP says the Presidents request to be furnished with a list of witnesses who assisted with the Public Protectors state capture report is an attempt at intimidation. Mentor spoke out against this on Facebook and she says her account was subsequently hacked because of the adverse and damaging comments she made about Zuma. In her affidavit, she has recounted how she was allegedly offered the position of Minister of Public Enterprises by the Guptas at their Sahara estate in 2010 on condition she cancelled South African Airways flight routes to India. She says the issue of state capture is the single greatest threat to the countrys constitutional democracy since the end of apartheid.
