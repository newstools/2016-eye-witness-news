The visit is apparently a follow-up to President Robert Mugabe's visit to South Africa last year. ZIMBABWE - State media in Zimbabwe is reporting that President Jacob Zumais due in the country next week and he'll be going with a business delegation to sign more agreements in ICT and energy. The visit is apparently a follow-up to President Robert Mugabe's visit to South Africa last year. Its being reported that Zuma will arrive in Zimbabwe on 2 November, but ministers will be coming earlier. TheSunday Mailquotes officials saying that South Africa is committed to working with Zimbabwe to help develop its economy. Its certainly an interesting time for Zimbabwes economy, with the Zimbabwean government having to provide a guarantee that the states energy company will meet its obligations to Eskom. Uncertainty is also high over the introduction of new local bank notes and the effect theyll have on the economy. South Africa is one of Zimbabwes top trading partners and during the last economic crises it was a favoured destination for migrants.
