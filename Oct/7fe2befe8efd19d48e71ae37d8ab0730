The group of student protesters is going from one building to the next to disrupt lectures. CAPE TOWN - More students have now joined a fees protest at the University of Cape Town (UCT). Demonstrators want to force the university to shut-down. But management says lectures are going ahead. The group of about a hundred protesters is going from one building to the next to disrupt lectures.  They are determined to shut-down the campus until their demands are met. Their grievances include fee increases and they are also calling for five suspended students to be allowed to return to campus and claim the institution's insourcing policy is flawed. A mass student meeting is scheduled to take place this afternoon.
