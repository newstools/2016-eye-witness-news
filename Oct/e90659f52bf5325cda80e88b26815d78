Police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate has confirmed it&#8217;s investigating the matter. PRETORIA - Criminal law experts who have studied video footage of the alleged hostage drama at the South African Revenue Services (Sars) have told Eyewitness News that the Hawks do have a case of kidnapping to answer to.Police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate has confirmed it s investigating the matter and has already requested warning statements from the officers involved.It's alleged detectives held a Sars employee against his will because he refused to hand over a document they claimed he had received in error.The document included an email exchange which showed the Sars attorney disagreed with the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Criminal law attorney Ulrich Roux says it does appear the conduct of the Hawks officials meets the legal definition of the crime of kidnapping. Kidnapping consists of unlawfully and intentionally depriving a person of his or her freedom of movement and I think if one looks at the video, that definitely a case can be made out for kidnapping. Advocate James Grant agrees. It appears that at least the conduct requirement of kidnapping was indeed committed by virtue of the fact that it seems as if his attempt to exit the room were blocked on two occasions. The Hawks say they will co-operate with Ipid in its investigation.WATCH: Hostage drama at Sars offices
