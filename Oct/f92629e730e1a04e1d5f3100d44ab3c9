Students have attempted to shut down the Pretoria campus saying they feel betrayed by management. PRETORIA Student leaders at the Tshwane University of Technology(TUT) says they want their vice-chancellor to put it in writing that there will be no fee increment next year. This is despite the institution releasing a statement in which it declares that the 2017 academic year will have a zero percent fee increase. The students from Soshanguve have gathered at the Pretoria west campus in an effort to shut down the campus, saying they have not signed an agreement with the institution regarding fees. Student leaders at the TUT Soshanguve campus say they feel betrayed by management after a decision was made to for classes to continue at the Pretoria west campus. They say the institution should legally bind itself to the no fee increments for 2017. Student Representative Council members say they are not involved in the protests, as they are afraid of being suspended by the university. However, other protesters say they will not stop until a binding statement had been released.
