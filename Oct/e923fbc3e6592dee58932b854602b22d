President Zuma says that in a democracy, it's alright for people to choose to get rid of their leader. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma says democracy is alive in the country and says people must not be worried when they look at what's happening and think the country is going down. Zuma was addressing the heads of mission's conference in Pretoria yesterday which was attended by the country's diplomats abroad. Without mentioning the ANC's loss of Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay metros in this year's local government elections, the president says it's alright for a party to lose what it had previously won. "One day the party that was winning everything cannot win others. It's democracy. One day you take those things back, that's democracy." The president has been facing increasing calls for him to step down. He says in a democracy, that it's alright for people to choose to get rid of their leader if they want to. "In democracy, people can get rid of the new leaders that they don't like and have the leaders they want. There is no problem about it. It's democracy." The president says while people could worry that the country is falling based on what's happening, democracy would never fall.
