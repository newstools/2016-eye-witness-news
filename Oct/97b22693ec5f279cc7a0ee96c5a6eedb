The DA's David Maynier says the Adjusted Estimates of Expenditure reveals shocking levels of wasteful expenditure. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says over a billion rand of wasteful expenditure is buried in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's mid-term budget policy statement.Gordhan delivered the mini budget speech in Parliament on Wednesday where among other things, he vowed to curb wasteful expenditure within government.But the DA's David Maynier says following careful scrutiny of the Adjusted Estimates of Expenditure, it reveals shocking levels of wasteful expenditure.Maynier says there are many examples of government wasting taxpayers' money. A new ministerial vehicle for the minister of trade and industry which will cost approximately R1.72 million and two ministerial vehicles for the Minister of Arts and Culture which will cost about R3 million. At the end of the day, it is simply wrong to waste money like this. Maynier says there are many areas where government can cut back on. The adjusted budget also includes R95.97 million on releasing transport aircraft, there is R32 million on cell phone data contracts and that s why we will be making proposals to amend the adjusted budget in Parliament.
