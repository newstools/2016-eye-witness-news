Bishop Jo Seoka says SA is rich with mineral resources and can be used to fund free tertiary education. JOHANNESBURG - The chairperson of the Bench Marks Foundation Bishop Jo Seoka says free education is possible in South Africa. Seoka says the ruling party (ANC) ascended to power with loud promises of free education. He says the fate of students' desire for what the Freedom Charter promised is like water in the palm of President Jacob Zuma's hand. Student protests flared up at universities across the country following Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande's announcement that universities would set 2017 fee increases within an eight percent cap. Seoka says South Africa is rich with mineral resources and can be used to fund free tertiary education. "We are in a country full of resources; you've got gold, platinum and diamonds. Our democracy hasn't delivered on its promises and I think what makes students angry is the issue of corruption where you see money being exchanged."
