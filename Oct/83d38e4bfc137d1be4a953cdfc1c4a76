Lehohla says the university system is inefficient, with a discrepancy between the higher number of enrolments and graduates leaving the system. If the throughput was successful, youd expect no more than 600,000 students, including those who pursue doctorates, if people dont fail or repeat the academic year. We have a million, so we have about 400,000 more students who are clogging the system. The figures show government funding has increased by 141 percent over the last decade, while enrolments grew by 32 percent over the same period. The system is inefficient, if you look at the number of first year students you dont expect more than 500,000, but we have a million. Were spending money on students that do not succeed and thats what making the system more expensive. The figures show that government grants make up nearly half of university income, while tuition fees constitute 34 percent. #StatsSAfees Lehohla: income - R63bn: 34% tuition fees, 42% grants and 23% other receipts.
