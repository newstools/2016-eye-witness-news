The revenue services says the company failed to declare a potential conflict of interest. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has instituted urgent proceedings in the high court to immediately terminate the Lekgotla Trifecta Consortium (LTC) contract. In a statement, Sars says this was done to properly comply with the law regarding organs of state to pro-actively raise and resolve procurement irregularities. The revenue services says the company failed to declare the potential conflict of interest between its director Nhanhla Ndlhela and Sars commissioner Tom Moyane. Sars say this constitutes material irregularity and breach in the awarding of the tender.
