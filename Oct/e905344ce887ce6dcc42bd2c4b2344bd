Zwane says as SA faces challenges, leaders must remain focused and not be drawn into petty issues. JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says as the country faces challenges politically, leaders must remain focused and not be drawn into petty issues. Zwane was responding to a question about whether he is concerned about the current developments around the finance minister. He told Eyewitness News he supports Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan as he faces fraud charges next week. Zwane was speaking on the sidelines of the South African National Minatory Veterans Association national general council in Boksburg yesterday. He says this is the time for leaders to be focused. &quot;So I believe that we should remain focused as I've said and refuse to be drawn into these petty issues that will defocus us, end up not doing our work as we're supposed to be doing.&quot; Minister Zwane was asked if he also supports the finance minister. &quot;I work with him, whenever he has problems we normally support each other. I also believe in this case there will be no difference.&quot; He was also asked if he agrees with Deputy Defence Minister Kebby Maphastsoe that the Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority are being targeted. &quot;There is a lot of noise that will not take us anywhere, so I believe we should refuse to be drawn into these petty issues.&quot; He said challenges currently facing the country require soberness from everyone. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has offered his moral and political support for Gordhan, along with ministers including Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom and Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor.
