The prison in the city's al-Zaydiyah district was holding 84 prisoners when it was struck three times. SANAA - Arab coalition warplanes struck a prison in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah, killing 45 people including inmates, a local official, relatives and medical sources in the Houthi-controlled Red Sea port said on Sunday. The prison in the city's al-Zaydiyah district was holding 84 prisoners when it was struck three times late on Saturday, the sources said. The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Houthi rebels since March 2015 to try to restore to office internationally-recognised President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was sidelined from power by the Iranian-allied group in late 2014. There was no immediate comment from the coalition. At least 17 civilians were killed in the southwestern province of Taiz on Saturday by a coalition air strike that struck a house, officials and residents said. The exiled Hadi on Saturday rejected a UN peace proposal to end the turmoil saying the deal would only be a path to more war and destruction. Speaking after meeting UN envoy Ismail Ould Cheickh Ahmed in Riyadh, Hadi said the agreement would &quot;reward the rebels and penalise the Yemeni people and legitimacy&quot;, according to the government-controlled Saba news agency. According to a copy of the proposal seen by Reuters, the plan would sideline Hadi and set up a government of less divisive figures.
