The device will be installed in homes in three informal settlements. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Government has launched the next phase of a R150 smoke alarm project. It's hoped the initiative will help curb the estimated 1,300 informal settlement fires in the Western Cape every year. The Social Development Department successfully completed the first phase of the smoke alarm campaign. Western Cape Disaster Management's Rodney Eksteen says the number of fire related deaths in South Africa has increased from 400 in 1980 to more than 2000 in 2014. Eksteen, Social Development MEC Anton Bredell and Premier Helen Zille attended the launch of the second phase of the photo-electric smoke detecting device being developed to reverse this trend. During the second phase, the device will be installed in homes in three informal settlements. Provincial government and sponsors will roll-out the device in some communities, but Zille has urged families to spend the R150 to ensure the safety of their families. The system comes with a 10-year battery life and a silence button to turn off the 85 decibel alarm for 10 minutes in case there is no danger.
