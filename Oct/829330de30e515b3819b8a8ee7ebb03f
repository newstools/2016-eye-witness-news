Zizi Kodwa says members of the ANC's highest decision making body will be supporting the minister. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says all available members of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) will be in court when Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan appears on fraud charges. The party's spokesperson and NEC member Zizi Kodwa has told Eyewitness News that members of the party's highest decision making body support the minister. Gordhan and two other Sars officials Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula face fraud charges in relation to the early retirement and reemployment of former Sars deputy commissioner Pillay. Over the past few weeks, some senior leaders of the ANC and Cabinet colleagues of Gordhan have come out in support of him, with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa offering his moral and political support. Now Kodwa says that he and other NEC members will be by the side of the minister. &quot;All available members of the ANC, including members of the National Executive Committee will be in court on 2 November when he appears.&quot; But some structures of the ANC including the MK Military Veterans Association, the ANC Youth League and ANC Women's League have been hard on those who have publicly supported the minister. ANC DIVIDED ON GORDHAN CHARGES At the same time, the ANC has appeared divided on the decision to charge Gordhan. Deputy president Cyril Rampahosa has issued a statement offering the Finance Minister his moral and political support, while the ANCYL has said he must be investigated by the ANC's integrity committee. This instruction from the party for NEC members to go to court with Gordhan may be an attempt to paper over some of those cracks. It allows Gordhan's supporters to go to court and say they are simply obeying instructions. But it also means Gordhan's critics can go too and attempt to control what is said about the case, if it does actually go ahead.
