Inresponse to a letter from the department calling for a stop to the boycott, the teacher union said it refuses to be intimidated by threats of legal action. Education MEC Debbie Schafer says there are implications for the unionsdisruptions. They still persists in calling for boycotts, instigating for people to disrupt school and stop our tests from getting into school; they are also traumatized some of our learners and ironically they more they carry on with this, they more its going to cost the learners.
