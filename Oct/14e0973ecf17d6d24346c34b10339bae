The group will deliver a letter to the SA ambassador in the hopes that it will be given to President Zuma. NEW YORK - A group of South African students in New York will today march in solidarity with protests taking place at universities across the country. The group is due to deliver an open letter to the ambassador of South Africa Mninwa Mahlangu at the South African consulate general. The group is expected to meet this afternoon and march from Bryant Park in mid-town Manhattan to the South African consulate where they will give their letter to the South African ambassador in the hopes that it will be passed on to President Jacob Zuma. The letter contains signatures supporting students' demands for free education, an end to out-sourcing at universities, and for the subject matter taught to be restructured.
