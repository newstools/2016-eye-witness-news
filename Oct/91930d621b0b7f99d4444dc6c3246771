Taxpayers should brace for hikes, which will only be unveiled in February's main budget. CAPE TOWN - Finance Minster Pravin Gordhan's set the country on a prudent fiscal path that keeps government spending in check and aims to pay down the country's debt. At the same time, he is trying to act with caution so as not to stifle what little economic growth there is. His medium term budget policy statement suggests that if growth remains below two percent for an extended period, the government might not get enough revenue to meet all its spending commitments. Gordhan was given a standing ovation by Members Parliament at the start and end of his speech, which also delivered a strong message about the need for integrity and accountability in those who serve in public institutions. South Africa is paying R147 billion this year just to service the R2 trillion national debt. While Minister Gordhan's found nearly R18 billion for higher education over the next three years, he's issued a stark warning. &quot;If we do not grow the economy, if we do not collect our revenue properly, if we do not generate revenue in the economy then we've got to take a squeeze if you like, and a hit - both on the tax side and the expenditure side.&quot; Taxpayers should brace for hikes, which will only be unveiled in February's main budget. &quot;We propose to raise an additional R43 billion through tax measures, R28 billion of which will be in the coming fiscal year&quot; These steps might somewhat dampen economic activity. But Gordhan's policy statement says a further loss of confidence and a ratings downgrade are a much bigger risk to the economy.
