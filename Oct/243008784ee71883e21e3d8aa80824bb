Senior members of the firm said that Van Rooyen would give them contracts when he became Finance Minister. JOHANNESBURG - Tokyo Sexwale says as chairperson of Trillian Capital, which has been accused of knowing in advance that Des Van Rooyen was going to be appointed finance minister, he's going to set up an independent investigation into the matter. TheSunday Timeshas claimed that senior members of the firm told staff that Van Rooyen was going to give them contracts when he became Finance Minister. Van Rooyen was only in the position for four days after President Jacob Zuma fired Nhlanhla Nene. Pravin Gordhan was later appointed to the position and Van Rooyen redeployed to head up the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. In a statement, Sexwale says he views the claims against Trillian Capital seriously but that verifiable evidence would need to be brought to prove the firm knew that Nene was going to be fired. He says he's now going to set up an independent investigation that will be led by an independent person. Sexwale's promised to name that independent person within the next three days and says that this probe will cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies.
