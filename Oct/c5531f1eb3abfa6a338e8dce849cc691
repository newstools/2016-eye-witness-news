Vice-chancellor Adam Habib says the university is not in the business of targeting student leaders. JOHANNESBURG - Wits University Vice Chancellor Adam Habibhas dismissed rumours that he or any member of management are targeting student leaders involved in the #FeesMustFall protests. Students last week claimed that their leaders were being targeted by police. Last weekend student leader Mcebo Dlaminiwas arrested and subsequently charged with damage to property, theft, assault and contravening a court order. He is due back in court next month. Habib says the university is not in the business of targeting student leaders. I am sure the national commissioner will be very willing to argue that he has said publically that there is no attempt to target individuals. We have engaged student leaders to try and ensure that if they are arrested etc. we try and address their certain circumstances. Protesting students at the University of Cape Town students are also demanding the release of Masixole Mlandu. He was arrested for allegedly breaking into the offices of the campus protection services in contravention of a court order barring him from the campus.
