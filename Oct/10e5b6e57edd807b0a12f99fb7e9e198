The new policy will require classes to be given in English with summaries provided in Afrikaans. CAPE TOWN - A lobby group opposing the Stellenbosch University's incoming language policy says the institution risks losing millions in funding if they introduce the policy next year. The university voted on the move in June, following calls by some students last year to make English the default language at the institution. The new policy will require classes to be given in English with summaries provided in Afrikaans. On Friday, lobby group Gelyke Kanse filed an application with the Western Cape High Court. The group's attorney Danie Rossouw says: "We have asked the court to find that should the language policy stand, it should also make a declaratory to the effect that Afrikaans now has a lesser status on the Stellenbosch University campus."
