Some workers already staged work stoppages at the George Municipality. CAPE TOWN - The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) is threatening strike action against 12 municipalities in the Garden Route and the Karoo. The union says it's in the process of declaring a dispute in the Bargaining Council due to what it calls "an unfair evaluation system," which apparently favours senior managers and disadvantages workers. It also claims workers' grievances are not addressed because municipalities have failed to convene local labour forums. Some workers already staged work stoppages at the George Municipality. Samwu's John Mcanjana says, "Management is not taking these issues very seriously and we have the confidence of the workers who want to on strike to defend some of their rights that are taken for granted by these municipalities."
