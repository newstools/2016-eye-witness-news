Sundowns have beaten Egyptian giants Zamalek over two legs. JOHANNESBURG - The sky is the limit! Mamelodi Sundownsare the 2016 CAF Champions League title winners. The Brazilians claimed a 3-1 victory over Zamalek over the two legs of the final. The Egyptian giants put up a brave fight, but they could not overturn Sundowns' 3-0 first leg victory in Pretoria last week. Zamalek scrambled a 1-0 lead in the second half on Sunday night, but they could not break down Masandawana's resolute defence. Bafana Ba Style has become the second team in Southern Africa to walk away with the title, after their rivals Orlando Pirates clinched it in 1995. In the first leg of the Champions League final last Saturday, Sundowns netted twice, with goals from Anthony Laffor and Tebogo Langerman, before an own goal from Zamalek's Islam Gamal made it 3-0. The Absa Premiership champions will now play against the champions of Europe, Asia &amp; South America in the FIFA Club World Cup in Tokyo in December. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane said there would always be opportunities for his team to win cup competitions such as the MTN 8, Telkom Knockout and Nedbank Cup, but the opportunity to be crowned the best club on the African continent doesnt come often. Leave these other things, Telkom, we have won, I mean thats nothing. Im not saying it means nothing, but it cant compare. Mosimane's gamble and hard work have paid off. Take a bow coach.
