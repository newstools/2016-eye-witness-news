The 'Sunday Independent' reported that Mthembu reminded Zuma how the ANC protected him. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Jackson Mthembu has reportedly lashed out at President Jacob Zuma accusing him of using state resources to fight Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The Sunday Independent is reporting that Mthembu exchanged verbal blows with Zuma's supporters at the party's national working committee earlier this week. According to the newspaper, the chief whip has reminded the president how the ANC protected him, when he was facing &quot;difficult times&quot; after being slapped with at least 700 corruption charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering by the scorpions under the Thabo Mbeki era. At the time, angry Zuma supporters accused Mbeki of using state resources to wage party battles, which led to ousting in Polokwane nine years ago. During the ANC's national working committee meeting this week, Mthembu is said to have openly accused the president of using state resources to take on treasury. Mthembu has described the charges against the finance minister as absolute nonsense and adds the Gordhan he knows is an honest man.
