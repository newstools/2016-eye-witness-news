Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation aim stop the fraud case against Pravin Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG Freedom Under Lawand the Helen Suzman Foundation have lodged legal papers, saying the National Prosecuting Authoritys (NPA) charges of fraud against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan have no merit, and can only have been brought for ulterior purposes. The two organisations also say that NPA head advocate Shaun Abrahamss conduct in holding a press conference to announce the charges was farcical and amounts to an abuse of power in its own right. The groups have lodged the papers as part of their application to stop the case against Gordhan, former South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Oupa Magashula and former deputy Sars commissioner Ivan Pillay. In their application the two groups say Abrahams used his press conference to smear a former Sars unit, and by implication the finance minister himself. They say there has been at best a fatal disregard for constitutional duty at the NPA or at worst, the institution is acting on the basis of ulterior purposes or bad faith. The non-governmental organisations say that the issues in respect of the charges are not complex - and that the prosecuting authority simply has no case either on the facts, or on the law. The two groups also investigate the fact that this issue was investigated by the priority crimes litigation unit and say that fraud and theft do not fall under this unit's remit. They say it has not been explained why this unit investigated a fraud charge when it is supposed to concentrate on war crimes, terrorism and treason.
