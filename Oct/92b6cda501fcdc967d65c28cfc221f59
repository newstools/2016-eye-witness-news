The EFF, DA and Save SA have also indicated they'll support for Gordhan who faces fraud charges. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it's been granted permission to picket outside the Pretoria High Court on Wednesday, in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan-and its calling on South Africans to join in their numbers. Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay will appear in fraud charges in relation to the early retirement and reemployment of Pillay. The Economic Freedom Fighters, Democratic Alliance and civil society group Save SA have also indicated they will support the Finance Minister. SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo says, &quot;We have done this because we believe that the charge was ill-considered. It came as a result of the change in terms after the NPA talked quite a lot about the so-called 'rogue unit' in Sars, but now charged Pravin on something completely different.&quot; GORDHAN SUPPORTERS UNDETERRED BY REPORTS OF PLANS TO DROP CHARGES The National Prosecuting Authority has denied claims that it plans to drop charges against Pravin Gordhan. Civil society groups and political parties say regardless of whether charges are dropped or not, the planned march in support of Gordhan and against state capture will continue on Wednesday. Earlier today the City Press reported that informal discussions are now underway between the NPA and the minster's lawyers and those of Pilly and Magashula who have been charged with fraud in relation to the early retirement and reemployment of Pillay. According to the newspaper, Abrahams has drafted a letter which is expected to communicate his intention to drop the fraud charges before the trio appear in court on Wednesday, but the prosecuting authority says there is no truth to the reports. Save SA spokesperson Lawson Naidoo says, &quot;We will continue with the actions that are planned for Wednesday because this is not just about the case against the minister of finance; it's about saving South Africa from state capture, from the manipulation of state institutions such as the NPA and Hawks.&quot; LISTEN: 5 reasons you should care about the NPA's charges against Pravin Gordhan
