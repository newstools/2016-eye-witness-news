The Constitutional Court&#39;s 30-day deadline expires today CAPE TOWN &ndash; Parliament&rsquo;s Police Portfolio Committee will not be instituting a disciplinary process against Independent Police Investigative Directorate&nbsp;(Ipid) head&nbsp;Robert McBride. The Constitutional Court recently set aside a decision by&nbsp;Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko&nbsp;to subject McBride to a disciplinary hearing, after declaring his suspension invalid. However, the order was suspended for 30 days for a decision on whether or not a fresh disciplinary process should be launched. The&nbsp;30-day deadline expires today. Nhleko wrote to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on 7 September 2016 asking her to direct Parliament&rsquo;s police oversight committee to institute new disciplinary proceedings against McBride. But committee chairperson Francois Beukman says, according to the opinion of a Parliamentary legal advisor, the committee cannot go ahead. &ldquo;In terms of the legal opinion it&rsquo;s clear that the matter can only be processed if there is a House resolution. Currently there is no House resolution, so the committee can&rsquo;t deal with the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The National Assembly&rsquo;s first plenary session this term is set down for next Tuesday.&nbsp; (Edited by Zamangwane Shange) CAPE TOWN &ndash; Parliament&rsquo;s Police Portfolio Committee will not be instituting a disciplinary process against Independent Police Investigative Directorate&nbsp;(Ipid) head&nbsp;Robert McBride.The Constitutional Court recently set aside a decision by&nbsp;Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko&nbsp;to subject McBride to a disciplinary hearing, after declaring his suspension invalid.However, the order was suspended for 30 days for a decision on whether or not a fresh disciplinary process should be launched.The&nbsp;30-day deadline expires today.Nhleko wrote to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on 7 September 2016 asking her to direct Parliament&rsquo;s police oversight committee to institute new disciplinary proceedings against McBride.But committee chairperson Francois Beukman says, according to the opinion of a Parliamentary legal advisor, the committee cannot go ahead.&ldquo;In terms of the legal opinion it&rsquo;s clear that the matter can only be processed if there is a House resolution.
