Nine people were arrested and several students were injured overnight. JOHANNESBURG - Police are maintaining a heavy presence at Wits University and its surrounding Braamfontein area after hours of running battles with protesting students on Friday evening. Nine people were arrested and several students were injured overnight. It's understood numerous vehicles, including an SABC truck, were damaged and various businesses left vandalised.  The Orbit, a well-known jazz club in Braamfontein, was directly affected by the looting and violence. The police's Sally de Beer says calm has been restored following overnight clashes. "Operational management has reported the situation is clam and quiet at the moment. The police will maintain a strong presence and we call on everyone to act within the law." A number of injured students took refuge in the nearby Holy Trinity Church. University management says demonstrators attempted to set alight four buildings, but the fires were extinguished on time. The university imposed a curfew for visitors may not enter its campuses after 10pm. It says although a heavy police presence is necessary at the moment, it's not sustainable. "We should not be resuming the academic programme with policing or security. The only way out is a negotiated outcome and we are very mindful of that. However, you are not going to get a negotiated outcome without a degree of stability at the institution," Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib said.
