Hlomane faces 28 charges, including rape, kidnapping and robbery with aggravated circumstances. CAPE TOWN - The alleged University of Cape Town (UCT) serial rapist is expected to face another pre-trial hearing in November. Patrick Hlomane appeared in the Western Cape High Court yesterday. He's been charged in connection with a string of attacks on women near Rhodes Memorial, between November and January. Hlomane made a brief appearance in court, where Judge Andre le Grange postponed the matter to the 14th of November. The state requested the postponement for the finalisation of a possible plea agreement. Hlomane faces 28 charges, including rape, kidnapping and robbery with aggravated circumstances. The state has a list of 44 witnesses that could be called if the matter goes to trial. The 35-year-old will remain in custody at Pollsmoor Prison.
