The strike, spearheaded by CSAAWU, has entered its ninth week. CAPE TOWN - Robertson Winery says it doesnt believe employees, who are on strike, are familiar with all the facts around ongoing wage negotiations. The strike, spearheaded by the Commercial Stevedoring Agricultural &amp; Allied Workers' Union (CSAAWU), has entered its ninth week. CSAAWUs Trevor Christians says workers are demanding a minimum wage of R8,500. Workers have given the union a mandate to negotiate a living wage and theyve asked us not to negotiate in terms of percentage. Robertson Winerys labour law consultant, Jeremy Chennels, says he doesnt believe all 220 workers are currently part of those negotiations. Im not convinced that employees on strike are familiar with all the facts. The fact is, the cost-to-company entrance wage into the winery at yesterdays negotiations seating is R4,672 per month. Chennels says the winery is being unfairly labelled. That wage is above what youd receive if you worked for the largest employer in the western Cape. It probably is difficult, but we believe that reference to apartheid wages or slave wages is in fact not the order of the day.
