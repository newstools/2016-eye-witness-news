Save South Africa&#8217;s Mark Heywood says the charges against Pravin Gordhan were baseless in the first place, and politically motivated. JOHANNESBURG Civil society group Save South Africa says the National Prosecuting Authority s (NPA) decision to withdraw charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two of his former South African Revenue Service colleagues shows that pressure from a united group of people can stop further attempts at state capture.NPA head Shaun Abrahams announced today he did not believe there was any intention by Gordhan, Oupa Magashula or Ivan Pillay to act unlawfully.The three were charged with fraud in relation to Pillay s early retirement six years ago.Save South Africa s Mark Heywood says the charges were baseless in the first place, and politically motivated. What has happened is that, despite the huffing and puffing of Shaun Abrahams, what really forced him to drop the charges was the combination of legal activism by groups such as Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation, as well as a mobilisation of public outrage. Yesterday civil society groups and political parties said regardless of whether charges were dropped or not, the planned march in support of Gordhan and against state capture would continue on Wednesday.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
