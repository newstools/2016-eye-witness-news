Save South Africa&#8217;s Mark Heywood says the charges against Pravin Gordhan were baseless in the first place, and politically motivated. JOHANNESBURG Civil society group Save South Africa says the National Prosecuting Authority s (NPA) decision to withdraw charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two of his former South African Revenue Service colleagues shows that pressure from a united group of people can stop further attempts at state capture.NPA head Shaun Abrahams announced on Monday he did not believe there was any intention by Gordhan, Oupa Magashula or Ivan Pillay to act unlawfully.The three were charged with fraud in relation to Pillay s early retirement six years ago.Save South Africa s Mark Heywood says the charges were baseless and politically motivated in the first place. What has happened is that, despite the huffing and puffing of Shaun Abrahams, what really forced him to drop the charges was the combination of legal activism by groups such as Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation, as well as a mobilisation of public outrage. On Sunday, civil society groups and political parties said regardless of whether charges were dropped or not, the planned march in support of Gordhan and against state capture would continue on Wednesday.At the same time, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says the Public Protector can t confirm or deny if the state capture report makes any adverse findings against him, and therefore he has been left with no choice but to launch an application for an urgent order interdicting its release.The Mineral Resources minister is the latest person to take legal action after it emerged on Monday that Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen had filed a second urgent application to halt the release of the Public Protector's state capture report. On Friday, van Rooyen abandoned his first bid to interdict the release of the much-anticipated report.Zwane and van Rooyen will join President Jacob Zuma in arguing that the report was rushed and shouldn t be released.Heywood says they believe it s imperative that the report be made public. This report, produced by the Public Protector, should be in the public domain and it will be eventually. He says President Zuma and the Cooperative Governance minister are fighting a losing battle. The fact that the President and Mr Des van Rooyen are fighting tooth and nail, a battle which I am telling you they will lose after they have spent a few hundred thousands more rand of the taxpayers money.
