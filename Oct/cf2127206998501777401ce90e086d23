Minister Masutha says a bill will be tabled in Parliament to repeal the implementation of the Rome Statute. JOHANNESBURG - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says a bill will soon be tabled in Parliament to repeal the implementation of the Rome Statute. He has also announced that government will withdraw its Constitutional Court appeal of the High Court ruling which found it was obligated to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. The Sudanese president was in South Africa in June last year to attend an African Union summit being held in Johannesburg. He slipped out of the country in contravention of a court order. The government yesterday informed the United Nations secretary general, announcing its withdrawal from the Rome Statute. Masutha says South Africas international relations obligations are incompatible with the Rome Statute. &quot;In exercising its international relations with foreign countries, particularly with countries in which serious conflicts occur or have occurred, South Africa is hindered by the implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act.&quot; The minister says processes to begin the withdrawal will soon be started in Parliament. &quot;In order to ensure South Africa's diplomatic continued ability to conduct diplomatic relations, a bill reposing the repeal of the implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act will soon be tabled in Parliament. We have already, in writing, informed the speaker of the National Assembly and the chairperson of the National Council of Provinces of this executive decision.&quot;
