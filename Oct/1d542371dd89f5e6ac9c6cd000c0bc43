The body says it doesn&#39;t have the security guarantees it requires to carry out humanitarian operations. NEW YORK - The United Nations does not have the security guarantees it requires to carry out humanitarian operations in eastern Aleppo or evacuate sick and wounded people from the Syrian city, UN humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke said on Tuesday. &ldquo;When the weapons fall silent, we need all weapons to fall silent. We need assurances from all parties to the conflict, not just a unilateral announcement that this will happen. We need everybody to give us those assurances before it is immediately useful for us to do anything meaningful,&rdquo; Laerke said. Russia said on Monday that Russian and Syrian forces would pause attacks on Aleppo for eight hours on Thursday to allow civilians and rebels to leave the city. &ldquo;The announcement that we heard was for an eight-hour pause but on consecutive days, for more than one day,&rdquo; Laerke said. &ldquo;When the weapons fall silent, we need all weapons to fall silent.
