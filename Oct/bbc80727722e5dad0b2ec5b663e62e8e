Minister Joematt-Pettersson said in October that Eskom was best-placed to drive the procurement process. CAPE TOWN Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says Cabinet will discuss a proposal that Eskom become the procurement agent for the countrys nuclear power programmeat its next meeting. Radebe was responding to questions after briefing on the outcomes of yesterdays Cabinet meeting. Energy Minister Tina Joematt-Petterssonsaid earlier this month Eskom was best-placed to drive the procurement process, while the Department of Energy would act as co-ordinator. The plan to put Eskom in the nuclear driving seat is set to come before Cabinet in two weeks time. Radebe says, Eskom being the agency is going to be discussed in the next Cabinet (meeting).The minister of energy will be bringing forth those issues for finalisation by Cabinet. Joematt-Pettersson told Parliaments energy committee earlier this month that Eskom will leverage its own balance sheet to raise the money needed. Eskom says it wants the first of two nuclear reactors operational in 10 years time. But a revised integrated resource plan, which tries to calculate the countrys long-term energy needs and ways of meeting them, has yet to be approved by Cabinet.
