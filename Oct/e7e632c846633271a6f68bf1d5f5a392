Two sisters &amp; their 3 sons between the ages of one &amp; eight and an 11-year-old nephew, died in the blaze. CAPE TOWN - Scores of Bonteheuwel residents are expected to hold a candle-light vigil in the Golden Gate area later today in honour of a family of six who lost their lives in a devastating fire. Two sisters and their three sons between the ages of one and eight and an 11-year-old nephew, died in the blaze at their home during the early hours of Wednesday morning. Their mother, the sole survivor, is recovering in hospital. It's believed an electrical fault caused the fire but this has not yet been confirmed. The Bonteheuwel Joint Peace Forum's Natasha Lodewyk says, &quot;They're devastated. They're one big family, everybody knows one another, so this has affected everyone in the community. It could have been my child and there's a lot of anger.&quot;
