Krejcir&#8217;s family say he is seeking extradition as he has repeatedly had his human rights violated. JOHANNESBURG - Radovan Krejcir's family says a letter ostensibly sent on his behalf offering to cut a plea deal in exchange for his testimony against top police generals was sent without his input.Yesterday, the letter sent by an attorney to south Gauteng director of public prosecutions was made public by Krejcir's nemesis private investigator Paul O'Sullivan.In the document, the lawyer asks for Krejcir to be extradited to the Czech Republic in exchange for his testimony.In a statement issued from the Czech Republic, his family says the letter from attorney Eric Bryer was written without any input from Krejcir.They say Krejcir first had knowledge of this letter last week once it had already been sent.The family insists that any names mentioned in the document were added with the help of O'Sullivan as he has his own agenda against these individuals and he is continuing with a conspiracy against Krejcir.The Czech's family say he is legally seeking to be extradited as he has repeatedly had his human rights violated and is currently living in inhumane conditions.They believe it is clear he will never receive a fair trial in South Africa.
