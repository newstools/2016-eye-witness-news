The HPCSA apologised for erroneously stating Noakes was found guilty by the Professional Conduct Committee. CAPE TOWN - Professor Tim Noakes says his lawyers are still deciding whether to sue the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA after they released an erroneous statement about him. The HPCSA yesterday released a statement stating Noakes was found guilty by the Professional Conduct Committee, before recanting that statement a few hours later. The Council has issued an apology for the incorrect statement. Noakes was called before the committee last year following a complaint by former president of the Association for Dietetics in South Africa, Claire Julsing-Strydom. The case relates to a tweet in which Noakes advised a mother to wean her baby onto a low carb/high fat diet. Noakes says he was alarmed when the statement was released yesterday. &quot;I think one of the keys is how widespread the message went, and we know that in the Transvaal it was the number one trend on Twitter. So that's how many people saw this misinformation, and that obviously alarming for us.&quot;
