The lead prosecutor in the Gordhan fraud case asked the Hawks to obtain a statement from Sars employee Symington, because he wrote a legal opinion in 2009 saying there is no technicality that prevents Sars from re-appointing deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay after he went on early retirement. It s been reported that the Hawks' Nyameka Xaba then emailed Sars lawyer David Maphakela saying Symington must answer the questions as matter of urgency, but Maphakela mailed Sars commissioner Tom Moyane saying he didn't want to get involved for ethical reasons because he has a different view to the hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Moyane then apparently forwarded the questions and Maphakela's statement by mistake, to Symington, and the Hawks demanded that he hand it over, which he refused. It's understood that Symington was then assaulted by Hawks officials and the document was snatched from him, he has since reported the matter to the police's investigating unit Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), along with recordings where he can apparently be heard saying he was held against his will.Symington says he cannot speak until it has been cleared with Sars. The Hawks say they will not comment on this issue, and Ipid has not been available to respond to the matter.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
