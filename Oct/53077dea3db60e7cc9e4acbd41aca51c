Busisiwe Mkhwebane&#8217;s told Parly&#8217;s justice committee she will abandon the use of donars, consultants. JOHANNESBURG - New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she will not seek donor funding for her office after it emerged her predecessor Thuli Madonsela secured $500,000 from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).USAID is the United States' lead government agency which is involved in supporting democracy and combatting extreme poverty around the world.Mkhwebane's told Parliament's justice committee she will also abandon the use of consultants, after telling Members Parliament (MP) PricewaterhouseCoopers and University of KwaZulu-Natal academic Janine Hicks helped compile Madonsela's state capture report.MPs raised concerns about foreign funding for the Public Protector's office suggesting its independence could be compromised.The Public Protector says donor funding is a thing of the past and that she understands its implications from her stint at the State Security Agency (SSA).&quot;On donor funding, I indicated that we will stay away from that.&quot;Mkhwebane says her office will also no longer make so much use of consultants.&quot;And that's a challenge, because the current state capture report, it was the consultants - it was only one senior investigator, a chief investigator, utilised in the office.&quot;She's asking Parliament for significantly more funding - a request that Madonsela was routinely denied - and says all her staff will be vetted for security clearance, because they deal with sensitive information.
