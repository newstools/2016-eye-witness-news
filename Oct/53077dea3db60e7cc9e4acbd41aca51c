JOHANNESBURG &ndash; New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she will not seek donor funding for her office after it emerged her predecessor&nbsp;Thuli Madonsela&nbsp;secured $500,000 from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID is the United States&rsquo; lead government agency which is involved in supporting democracy and combatting extreme poverty around the world. Mkhwebane&rsquo;s told Parliament&rsquo;s justice committee&nbsp;she will also abandon the use of consultants,&nbsp;after telling Members Parliament (MP) PricewaterhouseCoopers and University of KwaZulu-Natal academic Janine Hicks helped compile Madonsela&rsquo;s state capture report.
