Jeff Radebe has removed any doubt that Gordhan will spell out SAs financial situation next Wednesday. CAPE TOWN Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says Pravin Gordhanwill deliver his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, as planned, next week. The Finance Minister is set to answer to fraud charges brought against him by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in court on 2 November 2016. Cabinet has also expressed its support for Gordhan, while President Jacob Zuma has now included him in the task team dealing with campus turmoil over student fees. Cabinets statement delivered by Radebe today removes any doubt that the Finance Minister will be spelling out the countrys financial situation in Parliament next Wednesday. Radebe says while Cabinet has not discussed the merits of the NPAs case against Gordhan, it fully supports him, and says he is innocent until proven guilty. The Minister of Finance will table the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement on 26 October that will set out the broad fiscal framework over the medium term. He wouldnt be drawn on what would happen if Gordhan were to be found guilty on what some legal experts have described as frivolous and politically motivated charges. We cannot foretell whats going to be happening, so the attitude of the Cabinet as to what will happen, whether the NDPP will withdraw the charges or not, that will be discussed at the point that it happens, if it does happen Gordhan has now been included, along with a number of other ministers, in the ministerial task team dealing with the crisis in higher education funding.
