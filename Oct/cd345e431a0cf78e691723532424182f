The girl and her four-year-old sister survived an attack in which their mother and older brother were killed. CAPE TOWN - A three-year-old survivor of a multiple murder-suicide in Villiersdorp remains in a serious but stable condition. The girl and her four-year-old sister survived an attack in which their 28-year-old mother Christia September and six-year-old brother were killed. Their alleged attacker, the mothers boyfriend, then apparently hanged himself in the West Side informal settlement in Goniwe Park over the weekend. Patrick Naphai is believed to have attacked his girlfriend and her children with a hammer. Local councillor and Goniwe Park resident Rinah Mienies says the young survivor was beaten during the attack and remains in hospital. Mienies says September and her son will be laid to rest next week.
