ANC officials said this meeting would focus on introspection and on how to deal with factionalism. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) is due to report back today on whether its National Executive Committee (NEC) took any decisions regarding how to win back voters, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and if it also wants Hlaudi Motsoeneng to leave the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). The NEC was meeting over the weekend in what officials said would be an introspection into how the party lost control of three metros. Going into this meeting, ANC officials said this meeting would focus on introspection and on how to deal with factionalism within the party. But as some groups of the ANC appear to want African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be their next leader and some unions have already said they want Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, it could have been a difficult weekend. Students will be waiting to see if the NEC has supported their call for an ANC resolution on free higher education being introduced. But at this stage, it appears unlikely that officials will have seriously considered any calls for Zuma to leave office before the end of his term.
