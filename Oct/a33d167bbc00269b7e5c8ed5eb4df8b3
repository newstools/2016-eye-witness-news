Students are marching in PE where they will hand over a memorandum calling for a tax on the rich. CAPE TOWN - The Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) has closed its doors amid student protests. Demonstrators maintain it will remain shut until their demands are met. About 500 students are marching to the Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber offices in Port Elizabeth where they will hand over a memorandum calling for a tax on the rich.  Student Yandisa Dubase, who is at the march, says, "The Business Chamber is the centre of white capital within the city and if we do not tax the rich then we're not going to be able to get free education in our life time. That's the whole idea behind going to the Business Chamber, and it's to get our message across because we feel we're not taken seriously."  NMMU management says it's planning to resume the academic programme, although no date has been set. Meanwhile, University of Cape Town students have been marching ahead of a mass meeting.
