Busisiwe Mkhwebane and her team are briefing Parliament on her office s annual report. CAPE TOWN - Public Protector&nbsp;Busisiwe Mkhwebane&nbsp;says she cannot release the highly anticipated state capture report until the&nbsp;court process has&nbsp;been finalised. She made her debut in Parliament today,&nbsp;briefing the justice oversight committee&nbsp;on her office&rsquo;s annual report for the past financial year - something advocate Thuli Madonsela was scheduled to do last week before the meeting was postponed at the last minute.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s told the committee&nbsp;she doesn't&nbsp;like to refer to the report as "the state capture" report. The court will on 1 November hear an application by&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma&nbsp;that the report be held back because he has not had the chance to question witnesses and review any evidence that implicated him. Three businessmen, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, and companies they control are the subject of an official investigation into allegations that they have had undue influence over Zuma. The president has denied granting undue influence to the brothers and they have denied seeking it.&nbsp; FUNDING At the same time,&nbsp;Mkhwebane says her office needs extra funding of R28 million for this year, despite having cut costs and placing a moratorium on international travel. She has imposed the foreign travel moratorium yesterday and says it will remain in place until she reviews the situation. She says she wants ordinary South Africans to be able to hold their leaders to account, but that this does not mean high-profile matters will be marginalised. &ldquo;I envision a South Africa where duties are performed with integrity, free from maladministration, abuse of power and abuse of public resources in all state affairs.&rdquo; Mkhwebane&rsquo;s been warmly welcomed by members of Parliament from all parties including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the only party that voted against her stepping into Madonsela&rsquo;s shoes. The DA&rsquo;s Werner Horn has told Mkhwebane the party&rsquo;s never been more willing to be proved wrong about her. WATCH: Busisiwe Mkhwebane in Parliament Additional reporting by Reuters.
