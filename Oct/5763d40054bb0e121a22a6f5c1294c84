The NPA's claim that Arno Lamoer was in a corrupt relationship with a CT businessman will be tested next year. CAPE TOWN The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)'s claim that former Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer was involved in a corrupt relationship with a Cape Town businessman will be tested next year. Lamoer and his four co-accused will go on trial in the Western Cape High Court in March. They appeared in the High Court for a pre-trial hearing yesterday. The State and defence lawyers have indicated they are ready to proceed with the trial next year. All outstanding matters, including admissions and witness statements, have been finalised. The prosecution has previously said it has a strong case against the accused which is apparently supported by crime intelligence recordings. It allegedly proves Lamoer and three other former police officers received expensive gifts and cash from Saleem Dawjee in exchange for favours. They face 109 charges including corruption and racketeering.
