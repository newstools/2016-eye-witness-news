The SACP & the South African Law Society say that the SABC's board members have lost credibility. JOHANNESBURG - The Law Society of South Africa has added its voice to the chorus of calls for an investigation into the fitness of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board members. This comes after newly appointed SABC Communications Group Executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng penned an open letter, where he says his drive for transformation, has led to politically motivated attacks on his rights. The South African Communist Party (SACP) has also come out against him. The SABC board's decision to give Motsoeneng another senior position has been met with widespread criticism and comes after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a ruling in which his permanent appointment as chief operating officer was found to be unlawful and irregular. In his open letter, Motsoeneng highlights his qualifications. He says recent comments by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe and the African National Congress (ANC)'s Jackson Mthembu, who have been highly critical of the board, are legally unsound and defamatory. Motsoeneng says all his critics have ignored several court cases that have exonerated him and the broadcaster has complied with orders for disciplinary processes. Meanwhile, the SACP and the South African Law Society have called for an investigation into the fitness of the SABC board, saying all its members have lost credibility.
