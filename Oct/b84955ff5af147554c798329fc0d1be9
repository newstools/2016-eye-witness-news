The minister says he had not been afforded an opportunity to answer allegations levelled against him. JOHANNESBURG Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has launched an application in which he seeks an urgent order interdicting the publication and release of the Public Protector s state capture report.In a statement released by the Department of Mineral Resources, Zwane seeks an urgent order interdicting the publication and release of the Public Protector s findings and recommendations, concerning an investigation into complaints regarding any alleged improper and unethical conduct by the President of the Republic of South Africa and/or any other persons related to an alleged improper relationship with the Gupta family ( the report ), pending a review application to set aside the report . Minister Zwane has had no option but to now become involved in this matter, as he was not afforded an opportunity to answer allegations levelled against him (contained in a letter he received from the Public Protector) in terms of the Constitution, Public Protector Act and Promotion of Administration of Justice Act. The Public Protector cannot confirm or deny if the report, which is now alleged to be in final form, makes any adverse findings against the Minister. It is the Minister s submission that the report was hastily prepared without due regard to his constitutional rights. ZWANE ECHOES ZUMA, VAN ROOYEN S CONCERNS OVER STATE CAPTURE REPORTZwane claims the state capture report was hastily prepared without any regard for his constitutional rights.He is the latest person to take legal action after it emerged earlier today that Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen has filed another urgent application to halt the release of the state capture report. In a short statement released this afternoon, less than 24 hours before the state capture matter is heard in court, Zwane says the public protector cannot confirm or deny if the document makes any adverse findings against him.Like President Jacob Zuma and Van Rooyen, Zwane insists he wasn t given an opportunity to respond properly to allegations levelled against him.Zuma also wanted to interview witnesses who had presented evidence to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and questioned the finality of the report.The president s legal team has indicated that it will ask for a postponement tomorrow - one of the reasons is that former African National Congress Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor only filed her affidavit last week and they say they need time to respond.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
