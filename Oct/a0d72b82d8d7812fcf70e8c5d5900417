At 11am, the rand traded at R14.24 to the dollar, R15.81 to the euro and R17.51 to the pound. JOHANNESBURG - The rand has lost three percent of its value against the dollar following news on Tuesday morning that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan had been served a formal summons by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for his involvement in the so-called rogue unit at South African Revenue Service (Sars). The rand was the second highest emerging market currency after the Mexican peso yesterday due to a return in risk appetite. But today, the currency fell in a matter of minutes by as much as three percent when NPA head Shaun Abrahams announced Gordhan was being summonsed to appear in court next month. At 10am, the rand was trading at R13.91 against the dollar before weakening to R14.24 after Abrahams' announcement. By 11am, the rand traded at R14.24 to the dollar, R15.81 to the euro and R17.51 to the pound.
