He called on the MKMVA to take up arms in defence of President Jacob Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of the People (Cope) has laid criminal&nbsp;charges against African National Congress&nbsp;Youth League (ANCYL) President&nbsp;Collen Maine. Over the&nbsp;weekend, Maine called on the&nbsp;uMkhonto WeSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) to&nbsp;take up arms in defence of President Jacob Zuma. The ANC has condemned the youth league leader, describing his comments as reckless and irresponsible. Cope&rsquo;s Dennis Bloem has dismissed the ANC&rsquo;s condemnation, calling members of the party hypocrites. &ldquo;The call by ANC is one of hypocrisy and we are saying these kind of utterances are very dangerous, reckless and irresponsible. We have asked the police to investigate this case to lock Mr Maine up; he must have his day in court.&rdquo; At the same time, the Democratic Alliance&rsquo;s Samkelo Mgobozi&nbsp;says although it accepts the ANC&rsquo;s stance, it will still pursue the charges against Maine. &ldquo;He ought to be disciplined and not incite violence. Collin Maine has said some suspect things in the past, we feel that now he&rsquo;s gone too far and that he ought to be investigated and punished.&rdquo; (Edited by Winnie Theletsane) JOHANNESBURG - Congress of the People (Cope) has laid criminal&nbsp;charges against African National Congress&nbsp;Youth League (ANCYL) President&nbsp;Collen Maine.Over the&nbsp;weekend, Maine called on the&nbsp;uMkhonto WeSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) to&nbsp;take up arms in defence of President Jacob Zuma.The ANC has condemned the youth league leader, describing his comments as reckless and irresponsible.Cope&rsquo;s Dennis Bloem has dismissed the ANC&rsquo;s condemnation, calling members of the party hypocrites.&ldquo;The call by ANC is one of hypocrisy and we are saying these kind of utterances are very dangerous, reckless and irresponsible.
