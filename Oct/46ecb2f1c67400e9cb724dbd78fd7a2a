The ANC says a statement that Baleka Mbete had refused to keep the state capture report is false. JOHANNESBURG - The office of African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu, says an earlier statement claiming Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete had refused to safekeep the Public Protector's report into allegations of state capture, against President Jacob Zuma, is false. The party says Mthembu met with Mbete - who has distanced herself from the report released last night by the Parliamentary Communications Services, allegedly on her behalf - this morning. Mbete claims she did not instruct the department to release the statement, which she says does not represent her views. She has confirmed the report is currently being kept under lock and key in the National Assembly and will be handed over to new Public Protector,Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on Monday. ANC parliamentary caucus spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says, "The earlier reports derived from the statement of Parliament - that the speaker that has declined to take custody of this particular report - are inaccurate [and] unfortunate." Mothapo says they're disappointed. "We are disappointed by the inaccurate statement by an official in the Parliamentary Communications Services, which created an erroneous notion in the media that the Speaker has outrightly declined to take custody of the report." On Friday, advocate Thuli Madonsela confirmed that the final report had been handed to Mbete for safekeeping until the urgent applications brought by Zuma and Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen are heard in court.
