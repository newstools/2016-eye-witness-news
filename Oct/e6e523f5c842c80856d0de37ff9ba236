Christopher Panayiotou, along with his two co-accused, go on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court today. CAPE TOWN - The State will rely heavily on the testimony of the alleged middleman in the murder trial of Port Elizabeth teacher Jayde Panayiotou. The victim's husband, Christopher Panayiotou along with his two co-accused, go on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court today.  The 29-year-old businessman is believed to have hired men to kill his wife in April last year, with the help of his former employee, Luthando Siyoni.  Supporters of Jayde Panayiotou are starting to arrive at the Port Elizabeth High Court. Siyoni, who worked as a bouncer at Panayiotou's Infinity night club, will be one of the key witnesses in the murder trial.  Siyoni furnished authorities with information after his arrest, which allegedly incriminates Panayiotou as the mastermind behind his wife's kidnapping and murder. The onus will be on the State to prove Panayiotou did indeed call on his former employee to recruit hitmen to kill his spouse. The defence counsel will from the onset try to poke holes in Siyoni's version of events, as they try to prove their theory, that he was beaten into making a confession.
