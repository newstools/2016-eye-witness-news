It's reports the document states ANC regions believe Jacob Zuma should be disciplined. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it's not going to comment on reports that an internal party document says its branches believe both the national executive committee and President Jacob Zuma should step down. Business Day reports the document states ANC regions believe Zuma should be disciplined and want to know why the Constitutional Court's finding that Zuma broke his oath of office over Nkandla was not referred to its integrity committee. The ANC says it won't respond to these reports. They detail how this internal document says that a number of regions want President Zuma to resign. But political analyst at Unisa Professor Lesiba Teffo says this kind of finding is to be expected. &quot;If anything, these intended views are a representative of a sizable chunk that even those that yesteryear supported Zuma, feel that he has become more of a liability.&quot; He also says it's unlikely that anyone in the ANC will now be disciplined for campaigning against Zuma because he simply doesn't have the political power to take action against them.
