Gwede Mantashe warns the NPA mustn&#8217;t make mistakes like the decision to hastily charge Pravin Gordhan again. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must remain independent.The party released a statement today reacting to NPA head Shaun Abrahams s announcement that charges have been withdrawn against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.The ANC has warned the prosecutions body mustn t make mistakes like this again, and has asked President Jacob Zuma to engage with its leadership to ensure events like this are not repeated.Mantashe says many members were ready to support Minister Pravin Gordhan in the dock on Wednesday, but since the charges have been withdrawn, there s no reason to go to court.He says the ANC can t shape the NPA as this would a create disaster. The NPA must be independent; that talks to the feeling that is very strong within the ANC that the charges were political and our argument is that no institution must enter into the political space. They must allow ourselves to swim in the mud, in muddied political space no institution must come, that is our view. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
