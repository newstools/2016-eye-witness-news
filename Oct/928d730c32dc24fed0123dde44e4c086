NSFAS has made its last call to all those who qualify for funding to apply before the end of next month. JOHANNESBURG - The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has raised concern over the low number of matrics who have applied for assistance next year.The financial aid scheme has made its last call to all those who qualify for funding to apply before the end of next month.It has given an update on its centralised application process which was launched in August this year.NSFAS CEO Msulwa Daca says while over 195,000 students have registered on its website, most of the applicants are already in universities. We are concerned that the number of applications that we have received from grade 12 learners is not where it should be. Daca says while the online system is now fully operational, manual applications will still be accepted. We ve taken the decision that as we introduce the online-based system, we are not going to do away with the manual application form. NSFAS says it doesn t believe the low number of applications received from matrics is linked to the current Fees Must Fall protests.
