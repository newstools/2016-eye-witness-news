The water supplier is calling on residents to use water sparingly, as their reservoirs continue to drop. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Water says due to the heat wave that has hit the province this weekend, it is experiencing a high usage of water by city residents. The water supplier is calling on residents to use water sparingly, as their reservoirs continue to drop. It says it will be forced to close the reservoirs in some areas, if consumption is not reduced. Joburg Water's Tidimalo Chuene says they are currently on level two restrictions and has urged consumers to use other measures to cool themselves in this hot weather. &quot;The issue might be the type of activities that residents are engaging into to reduce the effects of the heat, and that's why we're saying sit in a shaded area, reduce the number of clothes. Cool yourself in other ways that do not use water excessively.&quot;
