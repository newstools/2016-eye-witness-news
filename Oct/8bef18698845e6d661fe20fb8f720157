The house and neighbouring properties were evacuated and a 200-metre cordon thrown around the area. LONDON - Counter-terrorism police investigating the discovery of a &quot;suspicious item&quot; on a London train this week said they found another such device on Saturday when they searched a house in Devon, western England. The house and neighbouring properties were evacuated and a 200-metre cordon thrown around the area while specialist officers investigated. On Thursday morning, the first device was found on a train at North Greenwich station, near the Canary Wharf financial district and close to the O2 music venue. Officers used a stun gun during the subsequent arrest in north London of a 19-year-old who was detained on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts and remains in custody. London's Metropolitan Police said on Saturday they had gone to a house in Newton Abbot, Devon, as part of their inquiries into the Greenwich incident. &quot;Whilst there, officers found an item they deemed suspicious,&quot; they added in a statement. &quot;Officers evacuated the address and alerted Devon and Cornwall Police.&quot; Police have not released details about the two items nor whether they were viable explosive devices. The first one was made safe by a controlled explosion. Britain is on its second-highest alert level of &quot;severe&quot;, meaning an attack is considered highly likely.
