Phehla died after he was run over by a car during Fees Must Fall protest last week. JOHANNESBURG - A Tshwane University of Technology(TUT) student leader, Lesedi Benjamin Phehla has been laid to rest in his village of Mmametlhake, in the Mpumalanga province. The 23-year-old's life was cut short during the Fees Must Fall protest outside TUT's Soshanguve campus when he was run over by a car that ploughed into a group of students. Phehla and three other students were rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. During his memorial at the university, TUT's vice-chancellor and principal Lourens van Staden announced the institution will introduce a new bursary named after Phehla from next year. &quot;The university management has resolved that from its bursary and scholarship funds, one of the bursaries will be issued to an academically deserving and financially needy student in the faculty of information and communication technology. The bursary will be known as the Lesedi Benjamin Phehla Bursary.&quot; Van Staden says the student leader died fighting for free, decolonised higher education.
