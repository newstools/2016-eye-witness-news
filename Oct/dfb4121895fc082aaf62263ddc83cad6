The new Public Protector is looking at reports of an unpaid bill for repairs to her predecessor's crashed car. JOHANNESBURG New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says her predecessors car crash case is still being looked at in an attempt to finalise the matter. A state-owned vehicle was damaged by Thuli Madonselasson in 2012, but Madonsela denies that she left behind an unpaid repair bill when she left office last Friday. There are reports that the cost of repairing the car was almost R500,000, but has since accumulated interest and now stands at R750,000. During an interview with 702's John Robbie this morning, Madonsela insisted the matter had been settled. That matter was dealt with by the Auditor General and by g-FleeT; and both of them came to the conclusion that I was not involved. I did not give instruction for the car to be used. Today during her first press briefing as Public Protector, Mkhwebane said the matter was still being addressed. I advised the chief finance officer, when the matter was raised by one of the media houses, that lets go and check the relevant documentation. Therefore, the matter is on the table [and] we are working on it.
