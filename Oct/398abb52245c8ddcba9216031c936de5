The resolution was adopted by a UN committee responsible for disarmament and international security. JOHANENSBURG - The International Relations Department has welcomed the United Nations resolution on the treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons. The resolution titled &quot;Taking forward multilateralism nuclear disarmament negotiations&quot; was adopted by a UN committee responsible for disarmament and international security. The resolution, which will be tabled for adoption at the general assembly in December, recommends the convening of a conference early in 2017 to negotiate a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons, leading to their total elimination. The department's Nelson Kgwete says, &quot;Two-thirds of the membership of the United Nations present and also that voted supported the resolution, which provides evidence of the call by the outgoing UN General-Secretary, to once and for all eliminate the threat posed by the nuclear weapons to the survival of the planet.&quot;
