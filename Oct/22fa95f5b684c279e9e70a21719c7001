The matric exams come amid a series of violent protests at universities over fee increase. CAPE TOWN - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has called on university students to exercise patience, because delivering fee-free tertiary education is a slow process. This morning, Motshekga visited Kensington High School, in Cape Town, to monitor the start of the 2016 matric exams. The national senior certificate exams come amid a series of violent protests at universities sparked by increasing tuition fees. The minister's spokesperson, Troy Martens, says it's clear matrics are worried about the prospect of going to university next year. &quot;I spoke to one of the learners at Kensington High School and she said she applied to Cape Peninsula University of Technology and she's very worried because their Bellville campus was burned down.&quot; Martens has pleaded with fees must fall protesters to let government's fees commission do its work. &quot;As a developing country it's very difficult for us to immediately - like the Fees Must Fall protest students are demanding - to make that happen.&quot; The ministry has urged first-year varsity students to complete the academic year to make room for the 2016 matrics.
