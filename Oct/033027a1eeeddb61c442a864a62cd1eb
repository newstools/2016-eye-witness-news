Wits University says it will persistently put measures in place to save the academic year. JOHANNESBURG - Wits University says it has no choice but to proceed with the academic year despite ongoing violent protests both on and off campus. The university says it cannot let the work already done and resources used throughout the year go to waste by shutting down as a result of Fees Must Fall protests. Wits University says although its caught between a rock and a hard place, it will persistently put measures in place to save the academic year. The university has deployed more security guards at bus stations, tighter security at entrances and exits and have requested police to escort university buses. Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said, &quot;We don't have a choice really. Our options are to finish the academic year of shut down the university. If we shut down, it's got consequences on 37,000 lives and it means we put their bursaries, NSFAS and funding at risk.&quot; Classes at the university continued for another week today as students prepare for the end of year exams starting in November.
