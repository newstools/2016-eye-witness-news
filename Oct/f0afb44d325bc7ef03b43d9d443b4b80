FUL and the Helen Suzman Foundation have gone to court to challenge the fraud charge against Minister Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG The National Prosecuting Authority(NPA) says it is surprised that Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation have gone to court to challenge the fraud charge against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. It says the institution had already told the two organisations that NPA head advocate Shaun Abraham s has asked investigators to clarify some details, before making a final decision on whether the prosecution will go ahead. The two groups have strongly cr it ic ised the NPA in their papers suggesting an ulterior motive could be behind its decision. The NPA's Luvuyo Mfaku says that Abrahams received the submissions from former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and his former deputy Ivan Pillay last week. He decided then to order that some outstanding issues be addressed related to the investigation, before he can make a decision on the matter. Mfaku says this means that those submissions may result in the case not going ahead. If this happens it could mean the challenge from the two groups is premature. Meanwhile, chief executiveof Goldman Sachs Colin Coleman says it's important to support the Finance Minister at this time. You know we have ratings agencies reviewing South Africas sovereign credit rating in the next couple of months. We have been working extremely hard on our economic growth which has been low. We hope we are starting to improve our democratic institutions which were trying to defend. Eighty-one CEOs, including Coleman, have backed Gordhan ahead of his medium-term budget speech this week, saying theyre against politically motivated prosecutions.
