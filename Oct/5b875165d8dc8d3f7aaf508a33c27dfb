Khoza says this victory puts South African football back where it belongs. In 1995, Patrice Motsepe's father held this trophy high when Pirates came back from Ivory Coast. Today Patrice's son is holding this trophy high, 20 years later. For me its very important that this achievement by Mamelodi Sundowns has restored the integrity and confidence of Premier Soccer League. #SundownsArrival The sky is no longer the limit for Mamelodi Sundowns. #KaBoYellow pic.twitter.com/4jWZusOAzP&mdash; EWN Reporter (@ewnreporter) October 26, 2016 #SundownsArrival The sky is no longer the limit for Mamelodi Sundowns. #KaBoYellow pic.twitter.com/4jWZusOAzP
