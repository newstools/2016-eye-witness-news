CAPE TOWN - A trial date has been set for a Guatemalan man accused of murdering his American girlfriend while on holiday in Cape Town. Diego Novella appeared in the Western Cape High Court today for a pre-trial hearing. Novella allegedly killed Gabriela Alban at a Camps Bay hotel in July last year. The prosecution says it has received a letter from the defence regarding a possible plea and sentence agreement. Defence attorney William Booth was not happy that the prosecution divulged details regarding the nature of their talks during the pre-trial conference. He says these discussions involve a number of aspects aimed at trying to shorten the duration of the trial. In the meantime, a trial date has been confirmed for April.
