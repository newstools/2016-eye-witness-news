Police are investigating after the building, which hosts university functions, was completely gutted. CAPE TOWN Police are investigating a case of arson after a building was set alight at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU). The Campus Boma, which hosts university functions, was completely gutted last night. It is the second building to be torched at the institution after a student recreation clubhouse was destroyed last week. No arrests have been made in either cases. NMMU spokesperson Debbie Derry says, Sadly our university boma, a building quite removed from our residences and lecturing facilities and which has been around for many years, was burnt to the ground overnight. The police are investigating.
