UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo says this will allow discussions between stakeholders to continue. CAPE TOWN - The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has suspended lectures for the rest of the week, pending the outcome of meetings with students. Over the weekend, the sixth annual Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture, normally held at UWC, had to be moved to the Artscape Theatre, as a precaution against potential protests. UWC says intimidation by demonstrators against staff and non-protesting students, has prompted it to suspend academic activity for the rest of the week. UWC spokesperson, Luthando Tyhalibongo, says this will allow discussions between stakeholders to continue. "We'll monitor the situation and update students by the end of the week on what the way forward is, and we'll also update students and parents and staff with regard to engagements that are currently taking place." He added management is looking at various interventions to ensure lectures and examinations will be completed for the 2016 academic year.
