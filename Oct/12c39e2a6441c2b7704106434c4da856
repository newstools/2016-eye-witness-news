Des Van Rooyen had applied to interdict former Public Protector Thuli Madonselas state capture report. JOHANNESBURG - Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen has reportedly withdrawn his application to interdict former Public Protector Thuli Madonselas state capture report. According to Business Day the reason given in Van Rooyens notice to withdraw is that Mandonsela had stated that no findings had been made against him in the report. Therefore he says no further purpose will be served by pursuing the application. Van Rooyen disclosed in court papers correspondence detailing the key allegations upon which he was implicated in the Public Protectors state capture investigation. These included that the Gupta family knew that hed be appointed finance minister before his brief stint and that on his appointment, he arrived at the Treasury with advisers aligned to the Gupta family. However, Van Rooyen strenuously denied the allegations. His spokesperson Legadimo Leso says hes heard that the application has been withdrawn, but cannot confirm this on the record as the minister is in Ecuador.
