The department appears to be on a collision course with Sadtu over systemic tests. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department(WCED) appears to be on a collision course with the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu). Teachers who are reportedly affiliated to Sadtu have been going to schools in Khayelitsha and other areas preventing tests aimed at measuring the quality of the education system from being written. The union is opposed to the assessmentsas it believes it further overburdens educators. Education MEC Debbie Schafer says the department has written to Sadtus national and provincial leadership. We will be approaching the court on Monday for an interdict against them and well also look at the costs being incurred by in delaying systemic tests. Well be seeking to recover that from Sadtu. In a statement, the union's provincial leadership has distanced itself from the acts of intimidation but has maintained that it is against the tests.
