Thami Tsolekile is due to appear in court today for the alleged assault of a 14-year-old boy. CAPE TOWN - Former Proteas cricketer Thami Tsolekile is expected to make a court appearance today for the alleged assault of a 14-year-old boy. The incident took place near Pinelands High School last month. Tsolekile is yet to plead in the case against him, but he has denied the allegations of assault. He has, however, admitted to driving the child to Pinelands High School to report him to his teachers. Tsolekile has told Eyewitness News the child allegedly threw stones at his car and swore at him. The former Proteas player captained the Lions cricket team and was handed a 12-year ban in August for match-fixing.
