The 17 Kraaifontein men were arrested 3 years ago in connection with the killing of six people. CAPE TOWN - Seventeen Kraaifontein men accused of vigilante murders could have conflicting testimonies in their trial. The group appeared in the Western Cape High Court for a pre-trial hearing today. They were arrested three years ago in connection with the killing of six people near Joostenbergvlakte. When the 17 accused lined up before the Western Cape High Court, it emerged some have different versions of what took place on 10 December 2014. They are accused of abducting suspected criminals, before stabbing and stoning them to death. Sixteen have appointed Legal Aid representation while one accused only applied today. Judge Elize Steyn today instructed the State and defence teams to sort out all procedures, including any possible admissions or pleas. She says this will allow the court to understand the case before the next hearing.
