Yesterday, the ANCYL's Njabulo Nzuza said that the league has no confidence in the deputy president. JOHANNESBURG - The office of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned comments made by ANCYL general secretary Njabulo Nzuza about Ramaphosa, saying they are unfortunate and without substance. Yesterday Nzuza told Eyewitness News that the league has no confidence in the deputy president and called him an unprincipled man with double standards. They are criticizing him for coming out in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who will be appearing in court next week on fraud charges related to the approval of the early retirement and reinstatement of former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. Spokesperson for the deputy president Ronnie Mamoepa says comments that Ramaphosa lacks principles and has caused a fracas by dividing institutions of state by portraying a government at war with itself, are regrettable. He says Ramaphosa's statement on the matter of Gordhan is consistent with official responses of President Jacob Zuma, Cabinet and the ANC. The support of Deputy President Ramaphosa on this issue is based on none other than the Constitutional principle of presumption of innocence until proven guilty by a competent court of law. He says the ANCYL's general secretary should have familiarized himself with the content of the deputy president's statement before commenting.
