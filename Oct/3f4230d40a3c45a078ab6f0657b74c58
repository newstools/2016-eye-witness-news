The actress thinks that overcoming a childhood stutter helped to shape her as an adult. LOS ANGELES - Actress Emily Blunt has revealed she was bullied as a result of her stutter as a child. The 33-year-old actress has admitted that the bullying she suffered as a result of her speech impediment taught her some important life lessons. She shared: "I think whatever you have to overcome in life ultimately paves the way [for whom you become as an adult]. "I got teased a lot, and to this day, I hate unkindness in people and bullies." Emily also revealed she treads a tightrope when it comes to her activity on social media, admitting she does not want to share too much of herself with the public because it could change the way she is perceived. The Girl on the Train star told InStyle magazine: "You've got to draw the line somewhere. "My job is to persuade people that I'm somebody else and allow them to go on that journey with me. If you share too much about yourself, people's interest becomes about you as opposed to the roles you have played." Meanwhile, Emily recently admitted that "everything changed" when she met husband John Krasinski. Emily and The Office actor were introduced through friends in 2008 and she has admitted their relationship enabled her to find her real self. Emily previously said: "I've experienced those moments of feeling less than, where I was just trying to figure how to be a strong person and own who I want to be, but not for a while now, not since I met my husband. "When I met John, everything changed for me, truly. And I really was emboldened to discover who I really am."
