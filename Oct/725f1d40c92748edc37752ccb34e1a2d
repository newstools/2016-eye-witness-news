Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she wants to empower South Africans so they can hold their leaders to account. CAPE TOWN - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says her vision is to empower ordinary South Africans so they can hold their leaders to account. She made her debut in Parliament today, briefing the justice oversight committee on her office's annual report for the past financial year. Mkhwebane was warmly welcomed by committee chair Mathole Motshekga before addressing the committee. "My vision is to have empowered people at grassroots level, who will be able to hold their leaders to account." The Public Protector says she wants to increase access to her office for ordinary South Africans and ensure that it responds to their needs. "Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean I am going to give high-profile matters less attention." Advocate Thuli Madonsela was due to have briefed the committee on this last Tuesday, but the date of the meeting was changed at the last minute. Mkhwebane is accompanied by deputy public protector Kevin Malunga and other executives as she meets with the justice committee. It will be an opportunity to set out her plans for carrying out the work of the Office of the Public Protector - which Madonsela complained was hampered by inadequate funding. Mkhwebane could also face questions about the status of Madonsela's final report on allegations of state capture - the subject of legal action launched by President Jacob Zuma and Minister Des Van Rooyen.
