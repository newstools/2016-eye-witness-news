President Jacob Zuma this morning announced Busisiwe Mkhwebane as the new Public Protector. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) chief whip's office has joined the presidency in thanking outgoing Public Protector Thuli Madonsela for her service over the past seven years. President Jacob Zuma announced this morning that her successor Busi Mkhwebane will take office on 15 October.  The ANC chief whip's office says it salute's Advocate Madonsela for a sterling and laudable job and says South Africans owe her a debt of gratitude.  Meanwhile, Corruption Watch says the newly appointed Public Protector has already indicated that she'll make civil matters part of her core focus. Managing Director David Lewis says: "The bulk of the work of the Public Protector is going to be on those issues that affect ordinary people, certainly in our own work we prioritise the so-called petty corruption cases."
