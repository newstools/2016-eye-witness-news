Water and sanitation dept says 6 weeks of consistent rain is needed to replenish dams. JOHANNESBURG - As the heatwave continues to cause much discomfort to people in various parts of the country, the water and sanitation department says the country's dam levels are still dropping drastically. The department says national water storage has been below 50 percent for over 200 days and continues to drop, despite some good rains experienced in several parts of the country last week. The department's spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says they need six weeks of consistent rains in order to replenish the dams to acceptable levels. Ratau says all South Africans should use water sparingly. &quot;You need to save water in households, but also in the streets, in agriculture and mining- everyone needs to save water, so we all have a common responsibility towards that. Let us continue to use water sparingly and wisely and where we do not need to use water, let us not use water.&quot;
