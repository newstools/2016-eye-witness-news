The ANC says the former MEC's suspension allegedly relates to her behaviour in the legislature last month. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC)in Gauteng says it's confident the suspension of former Sports &amp; Recreation MEC Molebatsi Bopapeis in line with the partys constitution. On Monday, the partys provincial working committee announced Bopape, who has been working as a member of the provincial legislature, has been suspended with immediate effect. Her suspension allegedly relates to her behaviour in the legislature last month, which the party says undermined the political authority of the ANC caucus. In September, Bopape, speaking in the legislature, threatened to reveal details about the handling of her case by Gauteng Premier David Makhura. Provincial speaker Ntombi Mekgwe refused to allow Bopape to address the house. The former MEC faced corruption and misconduct allegations during her time as Sports and Recreation MEC three years ago. Bopape has criticised the party for its handling of the matter and says she is considering all legal options to oppose the move. The ANCs Nkenke Kekana said, If you are disruptive in a meeting and if your conduct undermines the authority of the ANC, we have a responsibility as the provincial leadership to intervene.
