Joburg Water says it's noted a high consumption of water in Midrand, Soweto and surrounding areas. JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Water is appealing to all residents to use water sparingly, as reservoir levels are still very low. The water supplier says it's noted that there has been high consumption of water in Kyalami, Midrand, Soweto and surrounding areas. It says it will be forced to close the reservoirs in some areas, if consumption is not reduced. Joburg Water's Tidimalo Chuene says, &quot;At the moment, suburbs from Sunninghill towards the north; Kyalami and Midrand; are reporting water shortages and that is basically because there are areas that are consuming more water. We request that residents cooperate with us, reduce your consumption so that everyone else can have water.&quot; At the same time, Gauteng residents are experiencing a heatwave with temperatures expected to reach over 30 degrees Celsius. The South African Weather Service has warned the heatwave will hit the province over four days. Temperatures in Johannesburg alone are expected to reach 33 degrees Celsius.
