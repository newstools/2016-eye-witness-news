SA Rooibos Council say the trademarked products have helped expose South Africa to international markets. CAPE TOWN - The South African Rooibos Council says the popularity of rooibos and honeybush is showing impressive growth abroad. Council director Ernest du Toit is part of a South African delegation attending the 56th General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Switzerland. Du Toit says the trademarked products have helped expose South Africa to international markets. "Germany and Holland are already together consuming probably more than South Africa is but it's also popular in the United States, Japan and other countries in the Far East."
