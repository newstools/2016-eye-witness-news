SABC board members have been urged to resign ahead of a planned probe into its fitness to fulfil its mandate. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament has urged South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board members to resign ahead of a planned probe into its fitness to fulfil its mandate. Parliament's communications portfolio committee yesterday resolved to embark on a process to have the SABC board dissolved. Two non-executive board members resigned during a briefing by the board, on steps taken after a Public Protector report declared that SABC group executive of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng had fraudulently misrepresented his qualifications to obtain employment. ANC caucus spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says: "The honeymoon is over for those board members who have resided over chaos and the disrespect of the rule of law."
