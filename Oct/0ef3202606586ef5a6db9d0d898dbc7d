JOHANNESBURG African Union (AU) Commission Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says she cant be expected to react to rumours that African National Congress Womens League (ANCWL) want her to become South Africas next president. Dlamini-Zuma, who is in Pretoria to engage with South African editors, says women need to take their rightful place in society. The leader often touted as South Africas first female president says womenneed to be in leadership of the economy,academia and the judiciary.
