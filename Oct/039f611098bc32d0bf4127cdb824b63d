An unprecedented number of states put stricter election laws in place since the last presidential race. LONDON - With less than two weeks to go until the US election, all eyes are on the battleground states that will decide who gets into the White House. Preliminary numbers from early voting in some states appear to show democratic candidate Hillary Clinton with an edge in several of the 10 swing states, while republican Donald Trump has his own potential advantage in places like Ohio and Florida. In the penultimate week of campaign, Trump is taking break to attend official opening of new Washington DC hotel, a move he's been criticised for, as DC is not one of the 10 swing states vital for him to win the election. Meanwhile, Clinton is due to attend two rallies in Florida later today where the latest polls show Trump has a slight edge. An unprecedented number of states put stricter election laws in place since the last presidential race, and many are still caught up in litigation creating the potential for confusion on Election Day.
