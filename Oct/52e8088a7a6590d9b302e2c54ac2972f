A police officer, a paramedic and a former Sars official were arrested on Wednesday. JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks are investigating a case of the trade of illegal cigarettes in Limpopo involving four officials. A police officer, a paramedic and a former South African Revenue Service (Sars) official were arrested yesterday on suspicion of colluding with cigarette smugglers in Musina. It's understood the suspects used emergency and police vehicles to transport illegal cigarettes between Zimbabwe and South Africa. Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Matimba Maluleke says its not clear whether they're part of a syndicate. Some were operating individually and thats why they were arrested on separate days for smuggling illicit cigarette and the misuse of state property.
