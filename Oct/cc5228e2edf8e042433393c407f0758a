The man was arrested in Zimbabwe and will remain in police custody while awaiting his transfer to SA. JOHANNESBURG The National Prosecuting Authority says its working with Interpol to extradite a fourth suspect accused of being involved in the Rhodes Park double murder and rape case. The man was arrested in Zimbabwe and will remain in police custody while awaiting his transfer to South Africa. The suspect and three of his co-accused are believed to have been part of a group who murdered two men and raped a woman at the Kensington park a year ago. The deceased had been walking in the park with their partners when a group of suspects robbed and drowned them in a nearby lake. The NPA says the suspect will join Thabo Nkala, Admore Ndlovu and Mduduzi Mathibela who are currently on trial at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palmridge. The NPAs Phindi Louw says it is not clear at this stage, how long the extradition process will take as it depends on Zimbabwes urgency on handling the matter. It depends from country to country. With some countries we never struggle but with others it takes long. We are not sure as to when that process will be concluded. Louw says investigations are still underway to identify and arrest more suspects believed to have also been involved in the matter.
