The Finance Minister announced last week that an additional R17 billion would be allocated to students. JOHANNESBURG - Protesting Wits University students are having a mass meeting this afternoon to discuss to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's announcement on Fees Must Fall(FMF), during his mini budget, and to also discuss their plan of action for this week. The students have been protesting for over a month now, calling for free education. Last week Gordhan announced during his midterm budget speech that an additional R17 billion would be allocated to students and universities over the next three years-to help address the FMF crisis. FMF leader Busisiwe Seabe says they need to discuss how they will take their protest forward. &quot;Essentially, the way forward is also a report back not only myself but Mcebo (Dlamini), Shaeera (Kalla) and how we are going to deal with exams and there's also going to be a discussion around the minister's budget speech.&quot; STUDENTS CLAIM LEADERS TARGETED DURING PROTESTS Wits student accused the university and police officers of targeting fees protest leaders after the arrest of Mcebo Dlamini and assault of Shaeera Kalla. Dlamini was arrested at his residence at the university earlier this month. At the time of the student leader's arrest, Seabe claimed it came as no surprise as they believed the university had a 'hit list' noting students who have been active in the protests. Dlamini was arrested for allegedly assaulting an officer, but the charge has not been confirmed by police. At the same time, police are investigating claims of the use of excessive force by officers in the shooting in which Kalla was struck by at least 10 rubber bullets during a clash between protesting student and police.
