Two-year-old Braydon Graff was hit by a stray bullet on Saturday. JOHANNESBURG - Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder of a two-year-old boy in Atlantis. Braydon Graff was in his mother's arms outside a block of flats in Robinvale when he was hit by a stray bullet on Saturday. It's understood the shooting may be gang related. The polices Andre Traut said, On Saturday evening a two-year-old boy was shot and killed while he was with his mother. His mother and another person were wounded and admitted to hospital. Atlantis ward councillor Barbara Rass says its tragic that innocent children continue to lose their lives due to gun battles. Its sad to think that this is still happening and innocent children are suffering at the hands of people who are instructed to kill. Meanwhile, the three arrested men are due to appear in court later this week. Traut says, Investigations into the circumstances of the murder and attempted murder led to the arrest of three male suspects aged between 20 and 30 and once charged, they will make an appearance.
