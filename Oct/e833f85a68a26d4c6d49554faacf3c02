Miners who work as rock drill operators embarked on an illegal strike on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says 66 of its members have been staging a sit-in underground at the Gold One Modder East Operations in Springs, east of Johannesburg. Miners who work as rock drill operators embarked on an illegal strike on Tuesday, demanding a R250 bonus per blast. They vow not to surface until their demands are met. NUM's Livhuwani Mammburu says they are concerned about their members' lives and safety underground. "Our members are demanding R250 bonus per blast so we fully support them. They are also demanding that management not take disciplinary action against them when they come out underground because it's an unprotected strike."
