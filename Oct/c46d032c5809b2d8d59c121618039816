SAA board Chairperson Dudu Myeni says reporting losses cannot persist. JOHANNESBURG South African Airways (SAA) board Chairperson Dudu Myeni says the airline needs urgent and radical action in order to return to a state of financial sustainability.Following an Annual General Meeting today, which Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan attended, SAA announced a loss of R1.5 billion for the 2015/2016 financial year.This is down from R5.6 billion in the previous period.Myeni says even though the company has been able to reduce its losses there's a great deal of work to do. Although the airline has reduced its losses, the board and shareholders recognise that the trend of reporting losses cannot persist and that urgent radical actions are required. Myeni says the new board is committed to turning the business around.Treasury, earlier this year, meanwhile guaranteed the airline a R 5 billion loan.Myeni says this will be enough to keep the company going.
