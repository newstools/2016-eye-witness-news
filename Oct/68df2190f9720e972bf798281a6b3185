Zuma was asked about the impact the fraud charges against Gordhan would have SA's economic stability. CAPE TOWN President Jacob Zuma says the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan are a concern to all, including the investor community, but he says to intervene would turn South Africa into a banana republic. Zuma was answering questions in the National Council of Provinces yesterday on the eve of Gordhan's Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement which he is set to deliver in Parliament today. The president was asked about the impact on economic stability of the fraud charges brought against Gordhan by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Zuma told the House that economic stability was paramount, given the challenges the country faces. The recent events regarding allegations and lately charges preferred by the NPA against the Minister of Finance are a concern to all of us, including (the) investor community. Business leaders are calling on Zuma to intervene, but he says his hands are tied. I think if this president was to interfere in any matter either of Chapter 9 institutions or other institutions, then it would be closer to a banana republic. Zuma also denies he discussed the charges with NPA chief Shaun Abrahams at a meeting at ANC headquarters the day before they were laid. He says the meeting was with security cluster ministers and deal with a &quot;totally different matter&quot;.
