In the final sprint, Donald Trump is redirecting his attention to traditionally democratic states. NEW YORK - At least 21 million Americans have cast early ballots and the turnout so far appears to show Hillary Clinton with a slight edge over Donald Trump. But with just over a week to go until the country elects its next leader, an FBI review of new emails from an aide to Clinton has thrown another element of surprise into the US election.Clinton is back on the defensive again, tripped up by her decision to use a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. But according to most surveys, the review is not likely to change those who've indicated they'll be voting for the democratic candidate. With the FBI review underway, she will spend this week in critical battleground states like Florida and Ohio. In the final sprint, Trump is redirecting his attention to traditionally democratic states in an attempt to seize on what his campaign sees as a dramatic turn in the election.
