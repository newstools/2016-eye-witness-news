We are expanding the MyCiti bus network across the city and we also have the responsibility to protect the environment. BYD SA Company will also provide charging stations, technical support and training for bus drivers. The City says this project is also in line with its goals to expand public transport infrastructure, in a bid to reduce the number of vehicles on local roads.
