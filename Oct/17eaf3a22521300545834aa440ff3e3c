Siya Mlambo was found in KZN after he was taken from his home in what's believed to be orchestrated robbery. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police say they are working with their colleagues in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN)to track down a fourth suspect wanted in connection with the kidnapping of a 14-month-old toddler in Soweto. Siya Mlambo was taken from his Protea Glen home during what is believed to have been an orchestrated robbery by men who had followed his mother into the driveway. The toddler was found unharmed in Newcastle, KZN, on Thursday after a two-day search. The incident was allegedly arranged by Mlambo's nanny, who has been arrested along with two other suspects, who are due to appear in the Protea Glen Magistrates Court tomorrow. Gauteng police's Fred Kekana says, &quot;The team went to Natal, they are following some leads currently. As I am speaking the team from Gauteng is working with the team from KZN; they are busy following some positive leads.&quot;
