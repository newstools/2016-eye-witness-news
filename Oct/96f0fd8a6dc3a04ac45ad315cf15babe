She insists she cannot cannot comment on the way forward until the court proceedings have been finalised. JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebanesays she will prioritise the state capturecase based on the outcome of the urgent interdict due to be heard in court next month. Mkhwebane is due to submit her responding affidavit today, following President Jacob Zuma and Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyens applications to block the release of the report. She insists that she hasnt studied the report as it remains under lock and key and therefore cannot comment on the way forward until the court proceedings have been finalised. During her first media briefing as Public Protector yesterday, Mkhwebane made it clear that the state capture report will be made public if the court orders this. But for now, she cannot provide details of what will happen going forward and how she will proceed with phase two of the investigation. It will depend on the decision of the court. If the court says publish the report, we will go ahead and publish it and if the court says we need to deal with the matter differently, then definitely it will be prioritised. This week in Parliament, Mkhwebane raised the issue of consultants being used in the state capture investigation, saying she wants to stop this as part of a cost cutting measure. Meanwhile, former Public Protector Thuli Madonselasays using consultants to help her conclude the investigation was her decision and has nothing to do with Parliament.
