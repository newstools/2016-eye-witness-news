The Young Communist League says police have not produced any evidence linking detained students to arson. JOHANNESBURG The Young Communist League is calling for the release of all students who have been arrested during Fees Must Fall protests. The league says while it condemns the burning of property at some of the university campuses, police have not produced any evidence linking detained students to arson. Spokesperson Molaodi wa Sekake says the demand for free tertiary education is genuine. He says officers cannot be allowed to victimise students. Until evidence is presented forth, we believe there is no case against them. If theres evidence that says We have evidence of a specific individual burning property it would be unjustifiable for us to say those student must be let off. But in the absence of evidence, we cant have a situation where students spend weeks and months is jail.
