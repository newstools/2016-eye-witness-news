The union has boycotted the department's assessment of the quality of education. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department(WCED) says teachers union Sadtu has until 8am this morning to avoid being taken to court. The union has boycotted the department's assessment of the quality of education, as it believes the process overburdens educators. However, Education MEC Debbie Schafer denies this, saying external parties would hand out, collect and mark the papers. Schafer says disruptions to the process must be stopped. So we have given them one last chance until 8am on Monday morning. If they have not given us an undertaking at that stage to stop disrupting the tests, we will launch a court application for an interdict against them.
