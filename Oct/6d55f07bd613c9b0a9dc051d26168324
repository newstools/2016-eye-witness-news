At least two complaints have been laid at the judicial services commission by two advocates. JOHANNESBURG Some advocates at the High Court in Polokwane are calling for a review the appointment of Limpopo judge president Ephraime Makgoba. At least two complaints have been laid at the judicial services commission by two advocates whose cases were presided over by Makgoba. Advocate Kevin Maluleke has laid a charge of intimidation against the judge who threatened to deal with him both professionally and personally. There were four complaints which should have been dealt with by the judiciary before his appointment. When Eyewitness News tried to contact the judge for his side of the story, he said he would not be entertaining calls.
