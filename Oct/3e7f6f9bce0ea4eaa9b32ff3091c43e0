CAPE TOWN - A man who was caught damaging a police vehicle during last week's violent #FeesMustFall protests in the Cape Town CBD is expected to appear in court today. Police had been searching for the man, who's a cleaner at a University of Cape Town, since footage spread of him smashing the window of a SAPS vehicle. He was arrested on Friday. More than 300 protesters have been arrested since the start of September nationwide. The 33-year-old man is expected to appear in Cape Town Magistrates Court today on a charge of malicious damage to property. He was arrested on Friday at the university where he works as a cleaner. Photos of the man smashing the window of a police vehicle went viral on social media following Wednesday's protests. Acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane on Friday said he believes the #FeesMustFall movement has been hijacked by criminals. Phahlane said police will continue to act against any protester involved in unlawful activities but they will exercise restraint.
