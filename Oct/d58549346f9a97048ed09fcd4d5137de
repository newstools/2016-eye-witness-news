Gordhan is facing fraud charges relating to the early retirement and re-employment of former South African Revenue Service deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay, who is expected to appear in court next week. Various political heavyweights, includingDeputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada, have backed Gordhan. The ANCYLs Njabulo Nzuza says the committee must prove its own integrity by investigating Gordhan. When Marius Fransman was charged, the integrity committee zoomed in.
