The polices spokesperson Sally de Beer says they have now opened a culpable homicide case. JOHANNESBURG Police say they've not yet arrested the driver of a car that ran over a Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student who later died in hospital. Student leader Lesego Phehla was run over during a #FeesMustFall protest at the Pretoria campus earlier this week. Phehla and three other students were rushed to hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries. The polices spokesperson Sally de Beer says they have now opened a culpable homicide case. The driver is not under arrest. We will investigate thoroughly and once that is done we will take the investigation to the prosecutor who will decide whether to prosecute or not.
