Mkhwebane has held her firstbriefing as the Public Protector at her office in Pretoria. She says she's picked up on a number of issues that she willaddressduring her seven-year term. Mkhwebane says she cannot comment on whether former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela trusts her with the state capture report, or whether she believes the investigation was rushed. Mkhwebane says it remains under lock and key. Ill consult the attorneys and we must do it soon after this engagement, so I cant say what advice theyve given. Mkhwebane tried to steer clear of the state capture report, saying she wants to address issues of low staff morale at her office and cost cutting, among other things. She says international travel will be suspended, consultants won't be used and they will no longer accept funds from foreign donors.
