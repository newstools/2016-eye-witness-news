Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says they won&#39;t change anything in their game for the second leg. JOHANNESBURG &ndash; Mamelodi Sundowns are close to being crowned African champions, but they still have to negotiate their way past Zamalek again in the second leg of the Champions League final. Unreal game of Football, the Brazilians commanding from start to finish! Next stop, Egypt! #Sundowns #DownsLive #CAFCLFinal pic.twitter.com/3W2XsgmXua &mdash; Mamelodi Sundowns FC (@Masandawana) October 15, 2016 Sundowns netted 3 times&nbsp;on Saturday, with goals from Anthony Laffor, Tebogo Langerman, and an own goal. The Brazilians beat Zamalek 3-0 in the first leg, scoring two goals in the first half and the 3rd early in the second. Coach Pitso Mosimane says all his substitutions were forced. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring him in because I am preparing him. I didn&rsquo;t want to play with 10 men because he had a yellow card. So I sacrificed my substitutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mosimane says they won't change anything in their game for the second leg. &ldquo;We will play our normal game and if they have to push everybody forward, we have speed at the back and we can go out.&rdquo; &nbsp; Midfielder Keagan Dolly says they need to approach the second leg with the same fire they showed in the first leg. &ldquo;We know that we are still going to have to work hard and we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s over yet as they are good at home. We respect them but if we go with the same mentality and work hard we stand a chance.&rdquo; Dolly says they're under no illusion that Zamalek will throw everything at them in the second leg.
