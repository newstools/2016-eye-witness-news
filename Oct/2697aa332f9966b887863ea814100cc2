Michael Masutha says Shaun Abrahams was best placed to provide information on Fees Must Fall protests. PRETORIA - Justice Minister Michael Masuthasays it never crossed his mind that inviting prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahamsto a meeting with President Jacob Zumaat Luthuli House, the ANC's headquarters, would be an issue. Abrahams has come under fire afterit emerged that he attended the meeting the day before he announced the decision to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhanfor fraud. The charge relates to Gordhan approving the early retirement of former South African Revenue Services's deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. Masutha insists that Gordhans case was not discussed. That matter had already been communicated well ahead of that day and I had already communicated to the President the decision. It was absolutely unnecessary ta that meeting to repeat ourselves. He says he invited Abrahams to a meeting with President Zuma to discuss the unrest at universities. The last thing I had in mind was the mere fact that the meeting was taking place at the headquarters of the African National Congress would make an issue.&quot; Masutha believes Abrahams was best placed to provide information related to the Fees Must Fallprotests. The National Director of Public Prosecutions has been accused of being a pawn in Zuma's alleged cold war with Gordhan.
