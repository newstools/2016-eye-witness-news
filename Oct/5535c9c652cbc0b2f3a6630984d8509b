#FeesMustFall protests gripped the country after Minister Nzimande announced fee hikes for 2017. JOHANNESBURG - University students are expected to take their march for free, decolonised and quality educationto the Union Buildings this morning.

Tshwane metro police's Issac Mahamba says todays march will be deemed illegal. We might open a case against the organisers of the first march and should anything go wrong in this particular march, they might be held accountable. What we have to emphasise is that the first march was not approved. It will be categorised as an illegal march.
