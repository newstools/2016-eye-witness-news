Two cousins have admitted to killing their relatives, including a seven-month-old baby, last year. JOHANNESBURG - A Katlehong family say they are relieved two relatives have pleaded guilty to killing three of their loved ones, saying the confessions will help them find closure. Two cousins, aged 17 and 21 and cannot be named, have admitted to killing their relatives, including a seven-month-old baby, and leaving them in a bathtub filled with boiling water in December. A fourth victim survived the attack and ran for help. They appeared in the High Court sitting in Palm Ridge on Monday, where they pleaded guilty to three counts of murder attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. According to the 21-year-old's affidavit, they bought a drug called &quot;ice&quot; and smoked it on their way to meet their grandmother at a scrapyard in December. He says when they couldn't find her, they returned home where one of the victims told them not to smoke in the house. He says without uttering a word he stood up, and strangled her. In a separate affidavit, the 17-year-old killer says he rushed to the bathroom to tell another victim what he had just witnessed but when she started screaming at him, he panicked and strangled her to death. He says they then decided to put both victims in the bathtub and fill it with boiling water. They drowned the seven-month old baby in the same tub, because he was crying hysterically. Family spokesperson Kevin Mbingo says, &quot;We believe that if we stand together as a family, united we shall stand.&quot; The family says the confessions will help them find closure. The case continues for sentencing on 21 November.
