The SABC board has only 4 of the 9 members it needs for a quorum &amp; cannot make decisions. CAPE TOWN - The Parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board to hold office should be finalised before the National Assembly's last sitting for the year at the end of November. Communication's committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana announced a further postponement of the probeyesterday, saying due process had to be followed. The SABC board has only four of the nine members it needs for a quorum and cannot take decisions. All parties on the committee agreed earlier this month to institute an inquiry, which could lead to a recommendation that the board be dissolved. Parliament is trying to make sure the process does not open the way for legal challenges and delays. Maxegwana says theyre heeding the advice of Parliaments legal advisors. So we took it very seriously, the advice, when we start the process there are no questions about how weve gone about preparing for it. There are 26 names on the witness list so far, including former board members and executives whove been suspended or dismissed. Three of the remaining four board members have told the committee they wont resign. Maxegwana says notices of the inquiry will be served on them no later than next Friday after which a date for the inquiry will be set.
