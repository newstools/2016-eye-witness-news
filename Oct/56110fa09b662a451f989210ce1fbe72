The rand slumped after Minister Gordhan said the economy would grow by just 0.5% in 2016. JOHANNESBURG - The rand weakened against the dollar on Wednesday after Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan cut economic growth forecast and predicted wider budget deficits in his medium-term budget statement. At 1539 GMT, the rand traded at 13.9100 per dollar, 1.09 percent weaker from its New York close on Tuesday. &quot;Gordhan's budget plans rely on an economic acceleration that we believe is unlikely to materialise,&quot; Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note. &quot;If growth stays weak, South Africa will over-shoot its deficit and debt targets.&quot; The minister said the economy would grow by 0.5 percent in 2016, down from an estimate of 0.9 percent in February and forecast wider budget deficits for the next three fiscal years.
