The councils confirmed Ralebitsos resignation, but denies links to him signing pledge supporting Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG The Black Business Council has announced the resignation of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mohale Ralebitso, but denies it has anything to do with him being part of the group of CEOs who have pledged their support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Ralebitso, who only spent about a year as the councils CEO, says he plans to return to an investments company he owns. He was among the 81 CEOs who s igned a pledge in support of the finance minister, saying they stand against politically motivated prosecutions. This was seen as contrary to the Black Business Councils position. The council released a statement earlier this month, in which it welcomed the National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahamss confirmation that there was no political interference in the investigation. Ralebitso says he is simply leaving to focus on his business. The council also recently stated it would not support calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down, saying the President was elected through a ballot and should also leave in that manner.
