Michael Masutha says parliamentary approval wasn't needed to withdraw from the Rome Statute. PRETORIA - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says the executive did not need parliamentary approvalbefore deciding to withdraw from the Rome Statute. The ministerhas been speaking inPretoria after the announcement thatSouth Africais withdrawing fromthe International Criminal Court (ICC). The decision follows several court rulingswhich found government was obliged to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he attended the African Union summit in Johannesburg last June. Al-Bashir fled the country indirectcontravention of a court order. Masuthasays in terms of the Constitution, the executive has the authority to negotiate international agreements. Given the prerogative of the executive to enter into international agreements, it is equally the prerogative of the executive to withdraw from such agreements. He says Parliament has been informed of the decision. We have informed the Speaker and the chair of the NCOP of the executive decision, but also requested the Speaker to allow us an opportunity to make a ministerial statement in the assembly. A bill will now be tabled to repeal the implementation of the Rome Statute.
