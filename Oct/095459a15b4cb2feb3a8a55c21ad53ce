The fight broke out during a meeting of Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality officials last week. CAPE TOWN - The Congress of the People (Cope) has called for stringent action to be taken against African National Congress (ANC) members who were allegedly involved in bloody brawl during council meeting in Port Elizabeth. The fight broke out during a meeting of Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality officials last week. Two councillors were left injured, a security guard also apparently discharged a firearm. Cope's Dennis Bloem says, &quot;This type of behaviour is nothing else but hooliganism. We can see that the ANC don't want to accept the reality that they're no more in power in the Nelson Mandela Bay, in Tshwane Metro and in Johannesburg.&quot;
