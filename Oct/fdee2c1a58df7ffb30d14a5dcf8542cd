Some Danish stores have allegedly removed SA wines from their shelves following a documentary screening. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde says importers shouldn't base their opinion of the South African wine industry solely on a documentary on the working conditions of many local farm labourers. Winde says his department is investigating allegations of widespread labour law violations as depicted in the documentaryBitter Grapes - Slavery in the Vineyards. The department is still verifying reports that some Denmark supermarkets have removed South African wines from their shelves following a screening of the documentary this past week. Department of Labour spokesperson Sithembele Tshete has urged farmers to treat their workers fairly so as not to compromise their exports.
