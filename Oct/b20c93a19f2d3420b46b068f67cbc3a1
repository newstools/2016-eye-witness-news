Last year, the pass rate dropped to 70.4 percent compared to 2014. CAPE TOWN - Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga says for this year's matric exams, the department's focus will be on the quality of passes. The National Senior Certificate examinations 2016 kicked off today. Last year, the pass rate dropped to 70.4 percent compared to 2014. Motshekga's spokesperson Troy Martens says the department is paying particular attention to the three worst-performing provinces of 2015. &quot;We don't want to put a number on it but hopefully we hope to see improvement in our provinces that were in the bottom three last year. That would be KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and the Eastern Cape and a number of interventions have been put in place in those provinces. &quot; Martens, however, says it's not enough to see more learners pass matric. &quot;What's important is the quality of those passes, we want to see bachelor passes, passes in maths and science and more distinctions. That is really what we are aiming for. &quot; At the same time, the basic education ministry says it hopes learners in Vuwani have had enough &quot;catch up&quot; lessons to do well in the matric exams. More than 20 schools in the area were burnt down earlier this year during protests against a municipal demarcation. Martens says they're monitoring exams Vuwani closely. &quot;The province has put in a lot of mechanisms for that area specifically and because a lot of infrastructure was burnt down, we had to arrange alternative exam venues and so on. &quot; She says the affected schools have been working full throttle in the run-up to the exams. &quot;We hope those learners will at the end of the day have had the requisite catch up and supplementary lesson that they need to complete and do well in these exams.&quot;
