Joseph Mathunjwa says mining houses can't be trusted until a wage gap between CEOs & workers is narrowed. JOHANNESBURG - Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) president Joseph Mathunjwa says that in order to deal with the inequalities in the country, the capitalist programme needs to be radically disrupted. Mathunjwa was speaking at the Johannesburg Indaba in Sandton today, where the business community is meeting to discuss how to make mining a key driver of the economy. He says the unions cannot trust mining houses until the wage gap between CEOs and workers is narrowed. "How can I trust you when you're still paying a worker, who goes in the belly of the earth, R5,600?" At the same time, Dr James Motlatsi says the mining sector needs to undo its legacy of not taking care of poor miners. "At the present moment over 200,000 mineworkers, who were diagnosed with occupational diseases, have never been paid." The pair have also discussed the challenges faced by mineworkers and how the industry can assist them.
