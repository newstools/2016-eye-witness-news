The Democratic Alliance currently in a court battle with President Jacob Zuma over the report. CAPE TOWN Democratic Alliance (DA)leader Mmusi Maimanesays he will fight till the end to ensure the Public Protector's state capture reportis made public. The partys currently in a courtbattle withPresident Jacob Zuma whohas soughtto interdict the report into state capture. Maimane isin Port Elizabeth today to campaign for the DA ahead of a by-election in New Brighton in two weeks time. He spoke of how the DA-led coalition government in the Nelson Mandela Bay metrois fighting corruption two months after the election. Maimanes spokesperson Mabine Seabe said, We engaged in a fight to ensure the state capture report is made public. This is an issue all South Africans are talking about because when corruption happens, it is stealing opportunities away from South Africans. It also undermines the effort to deliver better services and create jobs. Seabe says the DA's determined to ensure the report goes public. We found it alarming that Minister Des Van Rooyen withdrew his interdict, saying there is nothing in the report that implicated him in any matters regarding state capture. So we find it surprising that he knows the contents of this report but us as complainants we dont.
