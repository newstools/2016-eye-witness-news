81 CEOs have backed Pravin Gordhan ahead of his medium-term budget speech this week. JOHANNESBURG - A group of chief executives who have pledged their support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhansay theyre not entering into the realm of politics but merelydefending their ability to promote economic growth. Eighty-one CEOs have backed Gordhan ahead of his medium-term budget speech this week, saying theyre against politically motivated prosecutions. Gordhan was charged with fraud by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) earlier this month for approving the early retirement of former South African Revenue Services acting commissioner Ivan Pillay six years ago. Gordhan is due in court next week to face these charges. The decision by the NPA has been highly criticised with several ministers, former ministers, struggle stalwarts and the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa publicly supporting Gordhan. The companies include Investec, Growthpoint, Woolworths, FirstRand, Discovery, Naspers, Goldman Sachs and Primedia (which owns Eyewitness News). Colin Coleman, the head of Goldman Sachs in South Africa, says the pledge by the 81 business leaders has very little to do with politics. We are defending our ability to promote economic growth, provide democracy, provide the economy and these are essential parametres under which it needs to be promoted. Coleman adds:What we believe in is the rule of law. We believe in the justice system and our democratic institutions being protected. What we dont want is arbitrary action.
