Five students erected a shack on campus to highlight issues of accommodation. JOHANNESBURG The Supreme Court of Appeal has upheld a High Court ruling preventing University of Cape Town (UCT) students from erecting an informal structure on campus. Five students appealed the initial ruling and turned down a compromise interdict offered by the court last month. That would have allowed them to resume academic activity. The students had erected a shack on campus earlier this year to highlight issues with the cost and availability of accommodation. UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola says, UCT notes and respects the ruling by the SCA and in terms of the judgment, the five appellants are interdicted from erecting unauthorised structures on any of the UCT campuses.
