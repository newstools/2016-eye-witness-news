The university's student representative council has distanced itself from the violence which unfolded following the incident. Classes were expected to get underway at the university today amid a high police and security presence. Professor Noor Nieftagodien, head of history workshop at the institution, said he's unhappy with the current situation. "The presence of security, both private security and police, is not conducive and makes it very difficult for the university to function." Nieftagodien said teaching is difficult under such conditions. "They may be fighting outside. They (students) hear the stun grenades, the tear gas comes into our classrooms and there's cops outside, we cannot teach under these conditions."
