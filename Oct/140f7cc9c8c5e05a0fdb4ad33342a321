Gwede Mantashe says he would prefer ANC members to keep their discussions within the party. JOHANNESBURG - As 101 veteran members of the African National Congress (ANC) have written publicly to the party saying it is losing the moral high ground, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe says its centre is not losing control of events. The members who wrote to the party include former National Assembly speaker Frene Ginwala, former finance minister Trevor Manuel, the former minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad and ANC stalwart Ahmad Kathrada. There have also been claims that cabinet ministers like Mosebenezi Zwane and Faith Muthambi have defied instructions from the ANC. Mantashe says while he would prefer ANC members to keep their discussions within the party, he does understand why people like Jackson Mthembu are speaking out. You can t bottle feelings of people when there are problems. We are going through a period where people will explode from time to time and that process must help ANC heal itself. But he also denies that the ANC is losing the power to actually control events. It's not losing control. Somebody was saying is the centre holding [up]? And I said 'yes the centre is holding' but sometimes cadres of the movement run away from the centre and therefore we must go and call them back to the centre and that will be ongoing all the time. Mantashe says they re speaking to all sectors of society to make sure they regain credibility and don t lose the 2019 elections.
