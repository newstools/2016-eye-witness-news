The Health Department says there is no truth to allegations that Life Healthcare Esidimeni is short of food. JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng Health Department has refuted claims that one of the NGOs that looks after patients who were transferred from Life Healthcare Esidimeni is short of food. The claim has been made by the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s shadow MEC for Health in Gauteng stating that the NGO in Attridgeville Pretoria relies on patients relatives and charities to assist with food. At least 37 psychiatric patients died after being transferred to various NGOs across the province earlier this year. The DA's Jack Bloom says the Tshepong Health Centre in Atteridgeville looks after 185 patients from Life Esidimeni and he worries that the patients are not receiving the nutrition they need. He says four patients died there this year. But the department's Steve Mabona says there is no truth to allegations that the health centre is short of food. We have sent our officials to this NGO to verify whether there is food and we can confirm and have pictures to share that there is food at this NGO. The families of the 37 psychiatric patients who died earlier this year, are expected to hold a prayer vigil outside MEC Qedani Mahlangu's offices next Thursday, in remembrance of their loved ones.
