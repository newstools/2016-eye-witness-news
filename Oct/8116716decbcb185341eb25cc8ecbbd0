The Labour Court aims to establish who was responsible for the decision to dismiss eight SABC journalists. JOHANNESBURG - The Labour Court has given the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) until next week Tuesday to rewrite and submit new affidavits, indicating who was responsible for the decision to dismiss eight SABC journalists. The court is trying to establish exactly who should be held personally liable for the legal bills incurred by the journalists. In July, the court found the dismissals of Foeta Krige, Krivani Pillay, Suna Venter and Jacques Steenkamp were unlawful and ordered the broadcaster to reinstate them with immediate effect. In the directive, the Labour Court states the affidavits received from the SABC's Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane and Simon Tebele were vague, and did not specifically mention who was responsible for the decision to dismiss the so-called SABC 8. Solidarity's Anton van der Bijl, whose company represented the senior journalists, says this is exactly the problem. "There's suspicion that there are other persons involved in that decision as well. What happened was that those individuals filed supplementary affidavits." This means more than two affidavits have been ordered by the court to be handed over next week. This includes affidavits from Ditlhakanyane, Tebele, other SABC executive members and possibly the SABC board.
