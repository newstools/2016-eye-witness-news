Busisiwe Mkhwebane says theyll also do away with consultants and focus on cost cutting during her term. JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says shes received a strong indication that Parliament will fund her office in future, saying that it is risky to rely on foreign donors. Mkhwebane was responding to questions during her first press briefing as Public Protector yesterday. Under Thuli Madonsela, the office had received $500,000 from the USAID and Mkhwebane says this threatens their independence. We wont be utilising the donor funding. We have requested Parliament to fund this institution and we have indicated how much additional funding we have. From the deliberations yesterday it was clear that they will be funding us, which we are hopeful. Mkhwebane says theyll also do away with consultants, suspend international travel and focus on cost cutting during her seven-year term.
