Gelyke Kanse is demanding that the University of Stellenbosch review its language policy again. JOHANNESBURG - Lobby group Gelyke Kanse has turned to the courts demanding that the University of Stellenbosch review its language policy again. The university voted on a new language policy in June, following calls by some students last year to make English the default language at the institution. The new policy, which is set to be implemented next year, will require classes attended by Afrikaans and English students to be given in English, with summaries provided in Afrikaans. Yesterday, Gelyke kAnse handed their application to the Western Cape High Court, arguing Afrikaans would no longer enjoy equal status alongside English as a medium of education. The application included several affidavits from Afrikaans students, as well as writers Breyten Breytenbach and Adam Phillips, among others. The group's attorney Danie Rossouw said, "Afrikaans and English should enjoy the same equal spaces on campus in addition to isiXhosa must be introduced for academic purposes."
