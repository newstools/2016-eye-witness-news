It&#8217;s understood the Hawks&#8217; Nyameka Xaba and others held Sars&#8217; Vlok Symington hostage over a document. PRETORIA - Dramatic recordings of the alleged hostage drama at the Sars headquarters reveal how senior Hawks officials held a revenue service employee against his will inside a boardroom, despite his pleas for help and calls to the police. The Hawks head of the crimes against the state unit Brigadier Nyameka Xaba and several colleagues went to Sars to obtain a statement related to the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Sars employee Vlok Symington provided legal advice to former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay when he applied for early retirement which is central to the case against the minister. A Sars legal advisor told Sars commissioner Tom Moyane in an email that he would not help the Hawks obtain Symington s statement on ethical grounds.It s understood Xaba mistakenly gave Symington a copy of the email exchange which showed the revenue services attorney disagreed with the prosecution of Gordhan. It was then that Xaba, at least three colleagues and Moyane s bodyguard held him in a boardroom. Symington called the police. I m being held hostage in my own office at the Sars offices. Can you send someone over please, as an emergency. I m being held hostage by the Brigadier and some other people. While being blocked from leaving, he called out for help as Xaba demanded the document back. Excuse me, it s not being sorted, I m being held hostage at this place. Brigadier what are you doing to me? I ve given you everything you wanted. Xaba is then heard saying, Give us that copy, we want the copy. Sars has not yet commented on the incident, while the Hawks have declined to comment. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
