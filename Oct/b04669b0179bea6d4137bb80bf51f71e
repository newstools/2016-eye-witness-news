Justice Minister Michael Masutha says that some heads of state cannot enter the country due to ICC laws. JOHANNESBURG - Justice Minister Michael Masuthahas emphasised that South Africas decision to withdraw from the RomeStatute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is aimed at creating peace and stability on thecontinent. On Friday, government announced that it had submitted a noticeto the United Nations, informing it of its intention to withdraw from the ICC. The decision follows several court rulings, which found that government was obliged to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he attended an African Union summit in Johannesburg last June. Al-Bashir fled the country in direct contravention of a court order. Masutha says there areother heads of state besides al-Bashirwho cannot enter the country due to these laws. He saysthe country's international diplomatic system is being held to ransom. Weve engaged on matters of mutual developmental interests. They are unable to come to South Africa because we cannot guarantee that this country will not invoke provisions in our domestic law or the ICC Statute itself.
