Students are singing and chanting across the Westville campus and have overturned a security company car. JOHANNESBURG - Eyewitnesses at the University of KwaZulu-Natal(UKZN) have shared images and videos of violent scenes on social media as students at the institution join in on the countrywide Fees Must Fall protests. Students have been seen singing and chanting across the Westville campus and in one instance, they overturned a private security company car.   It's understood cars are not allowed to enter the campus due to students blocking the entrances with rocks and burning rubble. This morning, the university management released a statement saying academic programmes have been suspended for the day in an attempt to restore calm at the institution. It has also obtained a court interdict preventing students from taking part in any unlawful protests and has warned that those involved in those protests will be arrested.  As a result, security and students have clashed with stones being exchanged by the two parties while a helicopter hovers over the campus. Students on social media have also reported high police presence.   There are also reports of rubber bullets being fired and tear gas thrown at the protesting students. While students also suggest their counterparts at UKZN's Howard College campus are also protesting and academic programme there has also been suspended. UKZN has not been available for comment.
