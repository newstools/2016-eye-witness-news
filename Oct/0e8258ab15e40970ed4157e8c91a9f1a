The 12 students will be accommodated at a building belonging to the Methodist Church in Belhar. CAPE TOWN - Twelve Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) Bellville students granted bail will be accommodated at a building belonging to the Methodist Church in Belhar.The protesters were today granted bail of R3,000 each after they spent a week behind bars. They've been charged with public violence and three face an additional charge of contravening a high court order.Strict bail conditions include being forbidden from coming within 200 metres of any tertiary institution in the Western Cape.That's a problem for the students who live on campus in residences.The court also needed alternative addresses in order to grant bail.The Methodist Church's Bishop Michel Hansrod says it was time the church stepped in and offered its help.&quot;Our country is in a crisis and off course it's of national importance and its affects the lives of every ordinary South African. We believe the church has a role to play in helping our nation find a resolution.&quot;In a statement to court, the church has given the assurance that students would be accommodated and fed at its facility for the duration of the case, which has been postponed to December.
