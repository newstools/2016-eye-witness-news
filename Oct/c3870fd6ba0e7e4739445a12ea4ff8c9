Babes Wodumo's song 'Mercedes' is believed to be about a street drug called Mercedes and was banned. JOHANNESBURG The Department of Social Development in KwaZulu-Natal has called on artists to ensure they use their craft to spread positive messages. MEC Weziwe Thusi has welcomed the SABC's decision to ban Babes Wodumo's song Mercedes. The song is believed to be about a street drug called Mercedes but the artist has denied this insisting the lyrics are about her favourite car. The MEC says there is a high use of drug abuse particularly among young people in KZN and the country cannot afford to have songs that could be perceived as promoting drug use. The department's Ncumisa Fandesi said, I think she was trying to speak to young people in a language that they understand but you dont have to speak that kind of language.
