These documents contain information about the so called spy unit set up at Sars. JOHANNESBURG - Lawyers representing the South African Revenue Service (Sars) want documents involving a controversial unit to be excluded from Adrian Lackay's constructive dismissal case. The former Sars spokesperson filed for constructive dismissal last year arguing that his working conditions had become unbearable amid allegations by commissioner Tom Moyane that an illegal spy unit had been set up by senior officials. Proceedings started in the Johannesburg Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) this morning. Before the merits of the case could be argued at the CCMA, lawyers representing Sars launched an application to have certain documents deemed inadmissible. These documents contain information about the so called spy unit set up at Sars which they believe has nothing to do with Lackay's decision to leave the revenue service. But Lackay's legal team has argued that the CCMA should hear all evidence before deciding whether or not this information is admissible. Lackay's decision to file for constructive dismissal stems from his conflict with commissioner Moyane and he's argued that working at Sars became difficult when he opposed Moyane's purge of senior officials among other things.
