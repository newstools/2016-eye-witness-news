The SA Law Society's co-chairperson says the ministerâ€™s silence on Hlaudi Motsoeneng is deafening. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Law Society has called on Communications Minister Faith Muthambi to take decisive action against the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board as per her political responsibilities. The organisation says the decision to appoint Hlaudi Motsoeneng as group executive for communications is in contempt of the Public Protector's remedial action. Yesterday, Motsoeneng penned an open letter where he responded to the widespread criticism of his new senior position, adding that his rights to fair labour practices have been infringed on. The Law Society has called for an investigation into the fitness of the broadcaster's board members and their ability to execute duties. Co-chairperson Mvuzo Nokyesi says the Minister Muthambi's silence is deafening. "It is on those basis that we've called on the minister to come out clear and take a decisive action and visible steps in ensuring that we restore the credibility of the SABC." The South African Communist Party (SACP) has also come out against the appointment of Motsoeneng. The SABC board's decision to give Motsoeneng another senior position has been met with widespread criticism and comes after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a ruling in which his permanent appointment as chief operating officer was found to be unlawful and irregular. In his open letter, Motsoeneng highlights his qualifications. He said recent comments by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe and the African National Congress (ANC)'s Jackson Mthembu, who have been highly critical of the board, are legally unsound and defamatory. Motsoeneng said all his critics have ignored several court cases that have exonerated him and the broadcaster has complied with orders for disciplinary processes.
