Somadoda Fikeni says the spotlight has also fallen on President Jacob Zuma numerous times in 2016. CAPE TOWN - Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says a large portion of South African politics next year will be focused on the African National Congress (ANC) and how it manages its succession struggles and internal affairs.Fikeni believes international perceptions of South Africa has wavered this year due to the various political situations.This year saw, among others the Constitutional Court ruling on Nkandla, the Hawks laying charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and withdrawing them, the SABC inquiry and the Public Protector s State of Capture report.Fikeni says the spotlight has also fallen on President Jacob Zuma numerous times. The international perception of South Africa had gone down because of many things focusing on some of our leaders particularly the president. But the most important thing also the Parliament created a theatre in the drama in a very spectacular manner. He believes changes within in the ANC will be leading political news next year. We saw how Parliament finally held state owned company like the SABC to account, so there is a redemption process taking place and that could even be noticed by the rating agencies as well. But again, what happens within the ANC will define 2017. 'RAMAPHOSA MUST SUCCEED ZUMA'In November, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) threw its support behind deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Zuma.The federation had held a media briefing following its central executive committee meeting.It all started at Cosatu's national congress last year when the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) proposed that Cosatu throw its support behind Ramaphosa, saying it was a matter of principle that the deputy president eventually became president.But Cosatu reprimanded the unions and warned them against discussing who should be elected president of the ANC until the party opened its succession debate.And then more unions joined the call to back Ramaphosa, including the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu).Cosatu's general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said a decision had been made.&quot;After intensive and robust debate the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the ANC, comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, to take over the reigns as the next president of the ANC.&quot;He said they also support the proposal that the ANC should explore the possibility of avoiding slates and contestation in its next conference next year.
