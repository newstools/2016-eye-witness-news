Blade Nzimande says it&#8217;s the liberals who are seen to be the champions of the Constitution. SOWETO - South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande has accused liberals of selecting parts of the Constitution which benefit their agenda such as protection of freedom of speech but slammed them for not fighting for the clauses that speak about land redistribution.Nzimande delivered the keynote address at the Young Communist League s third national council at the University of Johannesburg s Soweto campus on Saturday.He reflected on the tripartite alliance and questioned the relevance of the coalition with the African National Congress (ANC), which he says sometimes abuses the SACP.The general secretary says it s the liberals who are seen to be the champions of the Constitution. If you look at the issues they are emphasising in the Constitution, they are very selective. You find they emphasise freedom of speech [and] freedom of the media; but you will never hear them referring to a constitutional clause around the access to land. He says the Young Communist League should focus on achieving a socialist society in this lifetime.Nzimande says the ANC can no longer be in denial about this year s local government election results. We want to say, our programmatic slogan is even more relevant now: Socialism is the future, build it now. That is the key platform upon which you should seek to drive a second and more radical phase of our transition. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
