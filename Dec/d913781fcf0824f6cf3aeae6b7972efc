The African Diaspora Forum has marched on Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba&#8217;s office in reaction to his comments on foreigners living in the city. JOHANNESBURG The African Diaspora Forum (ADF) says the high influx of foreign nationals into South Africa should be blamed on the South African government for being unable to control its borders.At a march convened to submit a memorandum to the City of Johannesburg, the forum says not all foreigners are criminals and should not be grouped with those who are.Responding to remarks by Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba that foreigners living in the city contributed heavily to the crime rate, the ADF says their members are not to be blamed.Chairperson Marc Gbaffou said Mashaba should consult with government on ways to control migration to allow foreign nationals to be documented. We are saying that the department of home affairs is failing people to get the documentation. The mayor should start by speaking to Minister Malusi Gigaba. Gbaffou said they were handing over the memorandum because they were greatly disturbed by Mashaba s comments which appear to make a link between undocumented migrants and criminality.MMC for community development Nonhlala Sifumbu accepted the memorandum on Mashaba s behalf.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
