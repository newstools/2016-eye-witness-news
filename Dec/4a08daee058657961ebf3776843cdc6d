Van Zyl adds: What we ve done for the December period is that we upped security around all branches.&quot;This particular branch has been closed from Monday to allow the staff branch to have with contact with customers.&quot;She adds that the security company which monitors and patrols its branches has been placed on high alert.Meanwhile, the bank has declined to comment further on whether the branch customers who had their safety deposit boxes stolen during the heist will be compensated.Neither the bank nor the Hawks have been able to quantify exacyly how many boxes were taken or provide a value of the goods taking during the robbery.The bank also refuses to be drawn into what measures they take in order to protect security boxes, including whether the criminals had to gain access to a vault.One FNB customer says she had her valuables in storage for over 20 years.
