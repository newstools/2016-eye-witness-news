Equal Education says access to quality teaching and learning at independent schools has a major role to play in the performance of learners. CAPE TOWN While the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) is lauding its 98.67% matric pass rate, Equal Education says the results are in no way a reflection of the abilities of learners. The education rights group says access to quality teaching and learning as found at independent schools has a major role to play in the performance of school learners because the environment is more conducive to learning. Around 11,000 pupils sat for this year s IEB matric exams. Equal Education s Leanne Jansen-Thomas says this is only a fraction of the more than 700,000 learners who wrote matric at public schools countrywide this year. What is being provided in the independent schools is an environment that s far more conducive to quality teaching and learning, and so those people who are at independent schools have a better opportunity to learn.
