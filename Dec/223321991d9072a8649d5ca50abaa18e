Ipid head Robert McBride says Prince Mokotedi&#8217;s claims of plots to overthrow the government should be rejected. PRETORIA - Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride has dismissed Gauteng Hawks head Prince Mokotedi s allegations that he s plotting to overthrow the government, saying they are baseless. On Monday night Mokotedi opened a case against McBride, former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya, private investigator Paul O Sullivan and a crime intelligence officer. He accuses the four of plotting to have him killed, along with Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza and acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. He further alleges that the group was plotting an Arab Spring-style revolt in South Africa in order to remove President Jacob Zuma from power. McBride says Mokotedi s claims should be rejected. &quot;First thing to mention is the allegation made is based on a supposed set of information, hearsay of hearsay, from a single source and the statement that is being made must be rejected completely that there is any illegal activity that Ipid and its investigators are involved in. He has also has questioned the timing of the Hawks case against him because it was opened late on Monday night, just hours after watchdog investigators took a warning statement from Ntlemeza. Yesterday, warning statements were being taken from General Ntlemeza relating to a number of cases and complaints that were made against him. McBride alleges Ntlemeza threatened investigators that they too would soon be investigated, hinting at what was to come. During the taking of the warning statement, Ntlemeza indicated that 'this is just a game, you are taking my warning statement now. We ll be taking your warning statement tomorrow'. McBride says this isn t the first attempt to remove him from office and he won t be deterred. Click below to read Prince Mokotedi's affidavit.
