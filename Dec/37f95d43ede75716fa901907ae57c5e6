The public broadcaster has come under fire again, this time for moving ‘Generations’ to SABC 3. JOHANNESBURG - The public broadcaster has come under fire again, this time for moving Generations: The Legacy to SABC 3. The popular soapie will move in the middle of January, when the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) will be using the usual time slot to air games from the African Cup of Nations. TV critic Thinus Ferera says the decision will hamper the show's viewership. “The SABC is forcing its own viewers to sample other stuff.” (Edited Zamangwane Shange)
