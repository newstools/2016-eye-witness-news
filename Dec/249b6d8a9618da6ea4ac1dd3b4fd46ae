The JHB mayor says since taking over from the ANC-led administration he's been inundated with cases of corruption &amp; fraud. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) has lashed out at Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba s 100 days in office speech warning him to stop making public assertions about alleged corruption by the previous ANC-led administration.Mashaba commemorated his first 100 days in office on Thursday and delivered his progress report in Johannesburg.He says not all his plans have been achieved yet and may not be achieved in this financial year because he inherited a budget that was approved two months before he took over from the previous ANC-led administration. Mashaba says since taking over in office he has been inundated with cases of corruption, nepotism and fraud. I have reports from city officials in revenue, who have collaborated with people to reduce their property evaluations, to reports where debt write-offs have been pursued on the sidelines. However, the ANC in the greater Johannesburg region says there was nothing groundbreaking about the mayor s speech and plans. Spokesperson Jolidee Motonga says, In the inner city ourselves as the ANC government in the past five years, we ve attracted investments to the tune of more than R14 billion. If you look at the Maboneng Precinct, if you look at the Newtown Precinct, those are developments by the ANC. While Mashaba says he plans to grow the city s economy by 5%, Motonga says Mashaba hasn t presented a solid plan as to how he will achieve this.LIMITED BUDGET FOR HOUSINGMashaba says with the current approved budget, only 3,500 houses can be built annually while the backlog stands at 300,000 people.He claims his administration has managed to complete the housing list which dates back two decades and comprises 79,000 registered beneficiaries.Mashaba says, &quot;This current government with our potential balance sheet, we can deliver plus or minus 3,500 per year if we re lucky; the housing backlog is at 300,000.
