The veterans have raised concerns around the unity of the ruling party &amp; say urgent intervention is needed. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) veterans say they will now discuss whether the duration of the consultative conference, as suggested by the ANC, is enough to reflect on the issues facing the organistaion.The stalwarts met with some of the party s national office bearers, including Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte and Treasure- General Zweli Mkhize at Luthuli House on Monday.This was the third meeting the veterans had with the party since they expressed their concern about the state of the ANC under President Jacob Zuma.The party s highest decision making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), announced last week that it has agreed to the veterans' request to hold a consultative conference and that it would take place before the party's policy conference next year.The ANC has dedicated the first two days of the scheduled policy conference for the consultative conference.But the veterans, who asked for this conference, don t seem satisfied with the duration of time set aside. ANC stalwart Sydney Mofamadi says, The consultative conference must be on such schedule that allows it to finish its business. He says they still need to discuss the logistics of the conference, including who else must be part of it, apart from the party s branches and how those delegates would be identified.They have raised concerns around the unity of the ruling party and say urgent intervention is needed to rescue the organisation.MK MILITARY VETERANS INVITED The former Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) generals have conceded they've been standing on the sidelines for too long and say it's time they intervene.Speaking for the veterans, Sphiwe Nyanda said, The purpose of the gathering is to bring together former members of MK to assist with the key challenges facing the ANC. Nyanda said the ANC s top six, the party s stalwarts as well as the executives of the MK Military Veterans will be invited. Concerned comissars and commanders of MK will be convening a council of former MK members on 17 December. The MK veterans say it s no secret that the ANC is facing major challenges and needs help to redirect itself.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
