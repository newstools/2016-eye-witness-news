CAPE TOWN - The efficacy of South African laws will be evaluated in Cape Town over the next two days.A high level panel, appointed by the Speakers' Forum, will conduct public hearings at the His People Church in Goodwood.The initiative was established to gauge the impact laws governing the country have on the lives of South African citizens. Former president and chairperson of the high level panel on the assessment of key Legislation and the acceleration of fundamental change, Kgalema Motlanthe, says that language still poses a great barrier in translating laws to all South Africans. Language is a barrier also and the requirement is that bills must be written in two languages only. Once that requirement is satisfied the bills go through and they become law. Western Cape leader of the Kai Korana Khoisan group Chief Melvin Arendse stressed the importance of implementing legislation that will accelerate the pace of land redistribution. The Khoi land issue is not being resolved as yet. Cape Town is the sixth stop in a series of the public hearings. The next rounds will take place in Limpopo and Mpumalanga in January.(Edited by Neo Koza)
