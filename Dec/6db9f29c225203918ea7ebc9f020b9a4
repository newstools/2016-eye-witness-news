The police minister appeared before the committee on Wednesday to discuss various issues including allegations of R30m tender. CAPE TOWN Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has told Parliament s police committee it can prepare for more 'tarnishing' claims about him.He appeared before the committee on Wednesday to discuss various issues including allegations he awarded a R30 million tender to his girlfriend, and the acting National Police Commissioner s R8 million house.Nhleko says there a many allegations which are not being tested for truthfulness, including this one, which a committee member claims is based on alleged information from Interpol. The drugs that are being dismantled in laboratories by the Hawks and drugs that are recovered and so on, are not fully disclosed to the state. He has also pre-empted more allegations against him. There s also another claim that you re going to read about me very soon, which involves some prominent other person that I m said to be in a relationship with. He says the stories are intended to rubbish and tarnish the work his department does.'ALLEGATIONS UNTRUE'Nhleko has questioned why some of his accusers have not yet tested the truth of their allegations, among them the awarding of a R30 million tender to his reported partner.These also include the alleged spat between Nhleko and Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride.The minister has said these allegations are being linked in reports. What was very interesting to read was a caption which said the minister signs off R30 million to his partners, on the one hand he s hell-bent to restore reinstituting charges against Robert McBride . So, why this link? Nhleko has said all efforts have been made by the accusers to not deal with the allegations. If you have serious allegations of this nature, why are they not tested?
