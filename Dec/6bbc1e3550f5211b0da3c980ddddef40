Ousainou Darboe is on bail pending the appeal against his three-year prison term for mounting a peaceful protest. PRETORIA Gambia n opposition leader Ousainou Darboe has been released from prison, having been jailed since April by outgoing President Yayha Jammeh for mounting protests.Eighteen of his colleagues were released with him.Officially, Darboe is on bail pending the appeal against his three-year prison term for mounting a peaceful protest. So he might still have to appear in court.It s considered unlikely the case will be pursued as the Gambia undergoes a political sea change.Jammeh used his presidential powers to keep opponents behind bars.President-Elect Adama Barrow is unlikely to follow suit. Darboe is one of the political mentors of the property developer who scored a surprise victory in last week s presidential poll.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
