CAPE TOWN The Organisation Against Tax Abuse (Outa) says it has information that former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng used money from the public broadcaster to enrich himself.Yesterday, Outa laid criminal charges against Motsoeneng, who is now serving as SABC group executive for corporate affairs, and several former SABC board members on charges including fraud, misrepresentation and racketeering.The Western Cape High Court recently ruled he should not hold any position at the broadcaster. Outa's Wayne Duvenage says the charges relate to Motsoeneng and the board's alleged misrepresentation of his matric certificate. The continuation of his appointment by the board and various managers within the SABC, they too become co-perpetrators of that offence and need to be held accountable. Duvenage says they have information that Motsoeneng personally benefited from an agreement between the SABC and MultiChoice. Hlaudi Motsoeneng was enriched by over R11 million. Our concern is that this is the sale of government property, archived material the organisation enriched him of that illegal sale.
