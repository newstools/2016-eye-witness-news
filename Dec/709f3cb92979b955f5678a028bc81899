Julius Malema says the ANC hasn&#8217;t achieved anything that comes close to what Fidel Castro believed in. JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has used the party s memorial service of Cuba s late former president Fidel Castro to lash out at President Jacob Zuma, calling him a criminal and saying he has no right to say Castro must rest in peace because he sold out his dream.The EFF has held the memorial service in Soweto, a day after the African National Congress held its own on Wednesday. Malema also announced his party will send a delegation to Cuba on Friday.The EFF leader says President Zuma, who attended the memorial service of Castro this week, has no right to mourn him. Zuma is the Batista of our time and a criminal. He says even SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande can t claim Castro as his role model. Because if Fidel was his role model, he would have ushered in free education by now. Malema says only the EFF has the right to celebrate Castro s life and not the ANC as it hasn t achieved anything that comes close to what Castro believed in. #EFFCastro Julius Malema has arrived.
