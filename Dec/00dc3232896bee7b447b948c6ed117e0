Prophet Rufus Phala of AK Spiritual Christian Church in Limpopo says drinking Dettol is similar to Jesus turning water into wine. JOHANNESBURG Prophet Rufus Phala of AK Spiritual Christian Church in Moletji, outside Polokwane, says he has told the congregation to drink Dettol detergent because it was anointed.The Limpopo pastor who told congregants to drink the anti-septic liquid claims it heals sickness. He says although consuming the substance is dangerous it would not kill people, he's doing it through the power of God.He adds that it s similar to Jesus turning water into wine. It s Dettol but immediately after God touches it, it s anointed. It can change from Dettol to water or from Dettol to juice. Phala who is a mentee of pastor Lesego Daniel, who once ordered his congregants to eat grass and drink petrol, says he also practices what he preaches. When I drank it, it was pineapple juice. One man was using crutches but after drinking it, he stood up and walked.
