Absa recently revealed in court papers why it cut ties with the Gupta family. JOHANNESBURG - Absa says it s deeply concerned by Oakbay Investments businesses efforts to persuade Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to intervene in the bank s decision to cut ties with the Guptas family, saying doing so is tantamount to forcing the minister to act unlawfully.Absa became the latest bank to file an answering affidavit to the finance minister s application for a declaratory order, confirming that he is not permitted to interfere in the decisions of banks concerning their client relationships.The court papers were filed in the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday.This was after some Cabinet colleagues and the Gupta family asked him to intervene after four major banks closed the accounts of the family s Oakbay company earlier this year.Absa has revealed in court papers that it cut ties with the Gupta family because there was evidence of large unexplained transfers of funds from Oakbay companies, the company was not using Absa as a primary bank and it was moving their banking business to alternative financial institutions.The bank says had Gordhan acceded to the Guptas request to intervene, the consequences would have been significant.It states in the affidavit that the intervention would have undermined the confidence in the banking sector.It also says the minister would have set a dangerous precedent for a banking industry as a whole and contrary to the public interest and would have created risks for the confidentiality of relationships between banks and clients.Absa says it s for these reasons that it supports the relief sought by Gordhan.
