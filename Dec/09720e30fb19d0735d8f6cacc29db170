JOHANNESBURG - Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has announced plans to work with Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba to address the issue of undocumented migrants living in the city.Gigaba met with Mashaba earlier on Tuesday to discuss the mayor's controversial comments over illegal immigrants.During his 100 days in office address earlier this month, Mashaba said the city needs to be rid of illegal immigrants, some of whom he says are involved in criminal activity.Mashaba says he does not regret making the statements, which he claims were misinterpreted. I hope all of us appreciate the fact that we need to engage on this, but at the same time be sensitive and be careful of political opponents who are just there to spin and accuse. Gigaba says government has pledged its support to the city and will have further engagements to find solutions to the scourge. We attract immigrants because of the strength of our economy and democracy. Gigaba adds that although government is making progress in addressing the issue nationally, more still needs to be done.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
