LONDON - The United Kingdom s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has been rebuked after he accused Saudi Arabia of abusing Islam and acting as a puppeteer in proxy wars across the Middle East.The comments, made during a visit to Rome, are being viewed as hugely embarrassing to the UK and have prompted a swift response from the British prime minister s office that the views do not reflect the government position.The timing of Johnson s comments could hardly have been worse, coming as British Prime Minister Theresa May had just returned from a two-day visit to the Gulf.May had praised the Saudi royal family for its visionary leadership and highlighted the value of the UK s 100-year alliance with Saudi Arabia.Johnson was recorded criticising the quality of political leadership in the Middle East and accusing the region s politicians of twisting religion to further their political objectives. He said Saudi Arabia s behaviour was a tragedy.The prime minister s office has insisted the comments represented Johnson s personal views.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
