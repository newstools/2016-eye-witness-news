The Gauteng Hawks boss claims McBride was part of a group that discussed plans to start a popular revolt &amp; have him assassinated. PRETORIA - Gauteng Hawks boss Prince Mokotedi says Robert McBride, head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), and several other people have been monitored by police, Crime Intelligence and the State Security Agency since March this year.This comes after revelations on Tuesday that Mokotedi laid nine charges, including treason and conspiracy to commit murder, against a group of people.He claims McBride was part of a group that met in December last year and again in March this year to discuss plans to start a popular revolt and have himself and other senior police officials assassinated.Mcbride has denied the allegations.Mokotedi says after receiving an intelligence report earlier this year, McBride and several others have been monitored. In between March and now, we know that this group has been meeting. We have been monitoring the activities of a particular group. Crime Intelligence, as I said, will talk for themselves. I know they were also monitoring the activities of a particular group. However, Mokotedi has contradicted the statements in his affidavit, where he says under oath that the December meeting by the group was to discuss vexatious criminal investigations and shaming in the media. I received information from a source who said the group met on 3 December and assassinations were mooted for myself and general [Berning] Ntlemeza. McBride says this case is yet another attempt to remove him from office. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
