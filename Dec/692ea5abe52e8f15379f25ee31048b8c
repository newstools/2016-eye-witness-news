The JHB mayor says he stands by comments illegal immigrants leave the city because he believes rules must be upheld &amp; respected. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he stands by his statements for illegal immigrants to leave the city, adding that rules must be upheld and respected.Mashaba made the remarks last week following his 100 days in office address.The Home Affairs Department then issued a warning to the mayor, saying his comments could be misconstrued and lead to xenophobic violence.But Mashaba maintains people living in the city should have the necessary documents to prove that they are allowed to be in the country. People who are in our city illegally, whether you are South African or someone from outside, please respect our laws when you are [in our] city. If you do not we ll have a challenge. Our law enforcement agencies deal with cases on a daily basis of students being robbed and when they find people, they find them with no papers whatsoever. Mashaba previously said those living in the city illegally and involved in criminal activity would be targeted.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
