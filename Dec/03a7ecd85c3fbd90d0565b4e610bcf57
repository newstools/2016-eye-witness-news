Earlier this month, President Jacob Zuma had said the country's religious leaders should rather pray for SA. CAPE TOWN - Cape Town's Anglican archbishop has likened President Jacob Zuma's statement that the clergy should not be concerned with politics to that of an apartheid leader.Archbishop Thabo Makgoba delivered a midnight Mass sermon at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town on Saturday.Makgoba has warned a divided ruling party could result in policy uncertainty.He told the congregation he is pleased three of the Western Cape's dioceses in Cape Town, False Bay and Saldanha Bay have rejected Zuma's comments.He says the religious community should engage more on the political landscape in the country.Makgoba is adamant Zuma's call is reminiscent of what an apartheid era president would've said and is not what should be said by the head of state in democratic South Africa today.Makgoba has questioned whether religious communities in the country should withdraw their moral support for a divided government that's seen Cabinet members calling for the president to step down.Earlier this month, while speaking to Twelve Apostles Church in Christ members at an event in Durban, Zuma said the country's religious leaders should rather pray for South Africa and stay out of politics.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
