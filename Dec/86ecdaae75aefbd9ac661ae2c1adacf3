Inmates say prison management have ignored their plea for better treatment. JOHANNESBURG - Inmates at the St Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth say they are appealing to human rights lawyers and experts to conduct investigations on the recent deaths at the facility.Inmates say prison management have ignored their plea for better treatment and so far failed to suspend officials who were involved in the violent brawl that left three inmates dead and 30 others, including five warders, injured.The incident took place on Monday.The inmates have embarked on a hunger strike in protest against the institution's management.This prisoner says he's still horrified by the incident. Those inmates no longer had power. The officials had already overpowered them but they continued to drive them to another section where they could beat them without us seeing. One boy fell at the gate and the officials beat him to death. Management has reportedly told prisoners that it cannot suspend the officials involved because St Alban's is short-staffed.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
