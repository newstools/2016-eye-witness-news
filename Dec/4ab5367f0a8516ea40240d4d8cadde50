The WC police Commissioner says police need to be operationally alert &amp; always prepared for possible attack. CAPE TOWN Western Cape Police Commissioner Khombinkosi Jula says a new policy seeks to help officers be physically and mentally prepared for possible attack, whether on or off duty.This comes as five officers have been murdered in separate incidents across Cape Town recently.On Wednesday, three men were arrested for the murder of Constable Mziwonke Siwisa in Kraaifontein on Monday. Jula was speaking at a South African Police Service event on Wednesday.He says, Some of these members were attacked while in execution of their duties, some were on their way to work and some were on leave; so the 'back to basics' approach cultivates that culture and that sense for the members to always be operationally ready.
