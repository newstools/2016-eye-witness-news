JOHANNESBURG - Geoffrey Toyana says there are major positives to take out of his team's T20 Challenge despite missing out on the final.The Highveld Lions lost to the Warriors on Tuesday night in Port Elizabeth, going down by seven wickets after only managing 136 with the bat. Toyana says the competition has been an excellent breeding ground for young talent &quot;Giving these kids an opportunity is a positive. Our depth is showing nicely now. It's important that we back these young guys and make sure they are the future of Lions cricket and Cricket SA as well. Toyana says making the semi-final with a young group like this was already an achievement: &quot;To get into the semis with this young group is something special. I'm disappointed with the batting, two games in a row we didn't kick on. It's an area we need to improve on. Playing the Warriors here was always going to be difficult.&quot;Toyana says this young team is building a foundation for years to come: &quot;A guy like Bjorn Fortuin really came through for us. Hardus Viljoen starred as did Rassie van der Dussen with a broken finger. This is a learning curve to move forward. I believe this side can play together for the next 3/4 years.&quot;Friday's final will see the Titans hosting the Warriors at Supersport Park.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
