JOHANNESBURG - The Public Protector s office has responded to allegations that Busisiwe Mkhwebane harbours ill-feelings toward her predecessor Thuli Madonsela, calling them baseless and malicious.Recent reports claim that Mkhwebane threatened to withdraw South Africa s hosting of the African Ombudsman and Mediators Association general assembly in Durban if Madonsela attended.Madonsela eventually sent her former deputy to collect her certificate on her behalf.The Public Protector s Oupa Segalwe says Advocate Mkhwebane noted the reports seen on various media organisations sites over the weekend and is disappointed at these allegations.Media Statement: #PublicProtector @AdvBMkhwebane disappointed at baseless allegations peddled in the media pic.twitter.com/zxuqrdWY96He says their office doesn t know why Mkhwebane s predecessor decided not to attend the conference, but suggestions that it was because of her intervention are untrue.Segalwe says Mkhwebane enjoys a professional relationship with Madonsela. We reject the claim that Mkhwebane threatened to pull the plug on the general assembly if her predecessor was invited. The bottom line is that the general assembly went ahead and Advocate Madonsela did not attend it. #PublicProtector Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebana&#39;s office says the PP enjoys a professional relationship with her predecessor Thuli Madonsela.
