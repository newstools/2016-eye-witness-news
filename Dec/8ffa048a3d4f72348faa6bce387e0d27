Visitors were prohibited from visiting the lower forest following a devastating fire. CAPE TOWN - Parts of Tokai forest which were closed for nearly two years have been reopened.Visitors were prohibited from visiting the lower forest following a devastating fire last year.The Mountain to Ocean Forestry company which owns the timber was then given an opportunity to remove some of the damaged trees.SANParks spokesperson Gavin Bell said, There was a bit of a harvesting operation to remove those trees and obviously that was dangerous to the visitors. And with many of the burnt trees damaged by the fire they were falling down with winds and storms so we had quite a bit of work to get the area safe.
