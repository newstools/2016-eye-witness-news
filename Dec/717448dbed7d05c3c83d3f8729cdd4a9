South Africa could still be in risky territory in terms of next year's rating review. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa could still be in risky territory in terms of next year's rating review, following Tuesday's announcement that the economy grew at a less than expected 0.2% in the third quarter of 2016.This follows an increase of 3.5% in the second quarter.The largest positive contributor to growth was mining and quarrying, which rose by 5.1%, contributing 0.4% to gross domestic product (GDP) growth.Economists had expected a quarter-and-quarter GDP expansion of at least 0.5%, but the results released on Tuesday came in much lower.Growth within manufacturing contracted by 3.2%, with Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Industry in decline for seven consecutive quarters.Economist Thabi Leoka says the country is already in the fourth quarter and there s little room for improvements. I still have an expectations of GDP growth of 0.3% for the year which is very, very low. My forecast for next year is only one percent, so we re still at very risky territory in terms of negative ratings review. So far, South Africa has managed to avoid a downgrade after Fitch, Moody s and S&amp;P Global all affirmed its credit ratings.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
