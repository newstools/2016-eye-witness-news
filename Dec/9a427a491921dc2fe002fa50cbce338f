The Ipid head has been accused of trying to gather support from the public and media regarding a case against him. JOHANNESBURG - Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza has accused Robert McBride of trying to gather support from the public and media by speaking negatively about the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) and has urged the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head to rather cooperate with investigations.McBride chose not to appear before Hawks investigators to provide a warning statement on Monday as part of an investigation against him for defeating the ends of justice.The probe relates to two incidents which occurred during his term as Ekurhuleni Metro Police chief, almost a decade ago.McBride has accused the Hawks of not acting in the interests of justice and treating him like they treated Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.The finance minister was initially charged with fraud, only for the case to be withdrawn weeks later.The Hawks say McBride s remarks are concerning. Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says, What is disturbing is this sympathy that is being wanted or requested. He says instead of seeking sympathy, the Ipid head should cooperate with investigations.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
