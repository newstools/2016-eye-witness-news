Plato says the messages spread over the 16 Days of Activism period should be heard more often. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Community Safety MEC Dan Plato has called on all citizens to continue standing up against abuse as the annual 16 Days of Activism draws to a close.Plato is attending the final event in Paarl on Saturday following government s campaign to highlight the plight of abused woman and children.This year s theme is: Count me in; together moving a non-violent South Africa forward.Plato says the messages spread over this period should be heard more often. We can t just want to do this once a year; it has to be every day, every week and every month but this is only a couple of days in the calendar to raise the bar a bit and put the shoulders against the wheel. Plato has this warning for abusers. We will continue being in your backyard to stop the abuse. We will not condone it and we will not never agree to something like that. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
