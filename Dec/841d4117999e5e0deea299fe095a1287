While Sapu has welcomed the report which clears acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane of corruption, Popcru refuses to comment. JOHANNESBURG - While the South African Policing Union (Sapu) has welcomed the forensic report which clears acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane of corruption, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) says it will only comment once it s discussed its findings. Phahlane released the report in Pretoria on Thursday, which relates to allegations Popcru made in 2012 related to his term as forensics divisional commissioner. The claims form the basis of recent allegations that he used kickbacks to fund the construction of his house in an estate in the north of Pretoria, claims Phahlane has vehemently denied. Suspended National Commissioner Riah Phiyega commissioned the investigation, but she did not make it public when it was concluded in 2014. The Sapu s Mpho Kwinika says the report has vindicated lieutenant general Phahlane. We are very happy that the South African Police Service (SAPS) is being led by a reputable and honourable man. A person who s integrity is no longer questionable. Kwinika says the report wasn t released due to political considerations. They wanted him to remain with this tainted image so that he is not in the position to challenge them. Popcru s Richard Mamabolo says he will comment on the report once he has discussed it will union leadership.(Edited Zamangwane Shange)
