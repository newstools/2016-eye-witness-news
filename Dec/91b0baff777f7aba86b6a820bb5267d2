CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has questioned why some of his accusers have not yet tested the truth of their allegations, among them the awarding of a R30 million tender to his reported partner.The minister appeared before a Parliamentary committee earlier on Wednesday to discuss police issues that have been in the public domain recently.These also include the alleged spat between Nhleko and Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride.The minister says these allegations are being linked in reports. What was very interesting to read was a caption which said the minister signs off R30 million to his partners, on the one hand he s hell-bent to restore reinstituting charges against Robert McBride . So, why this link? Nhleko says all efforts have been made by the accusers to not deal with the allegations. If you have serious allegations of this nature, why are they not tested?
