On Thursday the football body announced that it had fired Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba with immediate effect. JOHANNESBURG - South African Football Association (Safa) CEO Dennis Mumble says no coach or player is bigger than the association. On Thursday it was announced that the football body had fired coach Shakes Mashaba with immediate effect.Mashaba was suspended after Bafana beat Senegal 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier in Polokwane on 12 November when he wagged a finger and angrily remonstrated at Safa president Danny Jordaan ahead of his post-match TV interview.Following a lengthy disciplinary process, Mashaba was found guilty on three charges: gross and personal misconduct and insubordination, as well as violation of the communications policy.Mumble says Bafana Bafana s wellbeing is always their top priority. The relationship generally with the media created some difficulties that affected the national team and really to make sure that this team works in a more positive environment. I think it s one of the reasons why we had to take this decision. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
