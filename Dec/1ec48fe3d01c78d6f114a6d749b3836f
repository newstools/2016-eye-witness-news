Steve Smit of Justice for Animals says the animals are subjected to being almost slaves for the people that ride them. CAPE TOWN Local animal rights groups have renewed their calls for a ban on elephant safaris in South African game reserves.This comes after elephant rides were outlawed in Botswana. From the end of the month, the Abu Camp has been directed to suspend its elephant-back safaris.The facility is the only one in Botswana to allow elephant-back riding.Steve Smit of Justice for Animals says, Treatment of the animals is a priority as far as the animal right movement is concerned. It s the indignity with which the animals are treated and subjected to being almost slaves for the people that ride them. However, the training is defended by those who say it s done on an encouragement basis. &quot;Elephants that are used in the industry or elephant back-riding are not treated well.
