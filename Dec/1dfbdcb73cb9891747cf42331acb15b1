Shadrack Gutto says Ipid and the Hawks won&#8217;t be able to fight crime effectively when the two are always at each other&#8217;s throats. JOHANNESBURG - A constitutional law expert is warning that tensions between Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride and the Hawks will not only affect the credibility of the institutions but also hinder their ability to serve the general public.McBride chose not to appear before Hawks investigators to provide a warning statement as part of an investigation against him for defeating or obstructing the ends of justice, accusing the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation of not acting in the interest of justice.The probe relates to two incidents which occurred during his term as Ekurhuleni metro police chief almost a decade ago.Ipid has also requested Hawks head lieutenant general Berning Ntlemeza to provide a warning statement on two cases of alleged perjury and crimen injuria.Shadrack Gutto says the institutions won t be able to fight crime effectively when the two are always at each other s throats. It seems to be a lot of political machinations taking place and it doesn t help the Hawks and it doesn't help Ipid.
