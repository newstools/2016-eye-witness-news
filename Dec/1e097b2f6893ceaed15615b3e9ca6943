The DA says it is possible that this year's learners may have been less competent than those from last year. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Umalusi's upward adjustments to 28 matric subjects was not based on the difficulty of the papers, but the low average mark obtained this year. The DA says it is possible that this year's learner's may have been less competent than those from last year, adding Umalusi may have adjusted the marks on the assumption that the papers were harder without looking at all factors. The party has written an open letter to Umalusi, demanding that they account for the adjustments towards historical averages. The DA's Gavin Davis says, My problem is this could mask a genuine decline in learner performance. And we re not sure whether or not the upward adjustment is because the papers are harder or because there s this tendency to ensure that there s a kind of equivalent mark across the years. #Matric2016: Open letter to Umalusi - @gavdavis https://t.co/rgYCWk0Wt3To get your 2016 IEB matric results now go to EWN s special matric results page.
