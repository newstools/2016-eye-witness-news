Crystal Palace, who are fourth from bottom, sacked Alan Pardew on Thursday after a dismal run of results. LONDON - Former England boss Sam Allardyce has signed a 2-1/2 year contract to take over as manager of Premier League strugglers Crystal Palace, the London club said on Friday.Palace, who are fourth from bottom, sacked Alan Pardew on Thursday after a dismal run of results.&quot;We are delighted to be able to make an appointment so quickly and fortunate that someone of Sam's calibre and experience was available,&quot; club chairman Steve Parish said in a statement.Allardyce's first match in charge will be the league game at fellow Londoners Watford on Monday.&quot;I hope we can bring some joy over Christmas and the New Year and, over the long term, between now and the end of the season,&quot; said the former Newcastle United, West Ham United, Sunderland, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers manager.&quot;The club seems to be very ambitious. Certainly the chairman and the owners seem to be taking the club forward in the right direction.&quot;Allardyce left his role with England by mutual consent after just one game earlier this year in the wake of a newspaper investigation which featured a video of him offering advice on how to &quot;get around&quot; FA rules on player transfers.GOOD ATMOSPHEREAfter one win in their last 11 league matches, Palace are seeking more solidity from a specialist in relegation firefighting.Their poor form has left them one place and one point above the drop zone. Palace have been in the top flight since 2013.&quot;They've held their Premier League status for a number of years now and there is always a very good atmosphere at the stadium,&quot; said Allardyce.&quot;I like the look of the squad and that's the reason I'm here. I think I can help the club go forward.&quot;At a news conference earlier on Friday, Palace assistant manager Keith Millen said: &quot;Certainly for players, he (Allardyce) is an experienced Premier League manager.&quot;Palace are getting an experienced manager. I don't know if Sam has got a point to prove with his career in league football because he has been very successful. The England job is very different.&quot;Of Pardew, Millen added: &quot;We have exchanged text messages. He is upset, disappointed but proud of what he has done here. Unfortunately, the results have not been good enough.&quot;
