Absa says that one of those reasons for the account closure was the evidence of large unexplained transfers of funds from Oakbay companies. JOHANNESBURG - Absa has revealed in court documents that Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments asked for the immediate closure of its account when the bank gave it notice in December last year but the company later appeared to regret that decision and tried to reverse it.The bank filed an affidavit in the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s application for a declaratory order confirming that he cannot interfere in the bank s decision to close accounts belonging to Oakbay.Gordhan claims he was pressured by some Cabinet ministers and the Gupta family to intervene after South Africa s four major banks cut ties with the Guptas.In the affidavit, Absa cites some of its reasons to cut ties with the Guptas including evidence of large unexplained transfers of funds from Oakbay companies and the fact that the Gupta family was not using Absa as a primary bank and intended moving their banking business to alternative financial institutions.The court document also includes letters from Oakbay companies which, after they were given notice of the Absa decision in December last year, insisted on the immediate closure of their accounts in February. Later they appeared to regret their haste, requesting a meeting to discuss the matter.However, the bank s chief executive declined to meet with Oakbay representatives.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
