CAPE TOWN The Western Cape High Court has found a Paarl man convicted of raping and killing his ex-girlfriend s 10-year-old sister had enough time to move her body.Jerome Amerika was found guilty of raping and killing Shamonique Claasen in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday.The 23-year-old was arrested after the child s body was found in a relative s house that stood adjacent to her parent's Wendy House in February.Amerika was in a relationship with Shamonique s eldest sister. The couple shared a room in the house where the 10-year-old s body was discovered.Judge Robert Henney found it strange that Amerika did not try to find the cause of a foul smell in the room.The family initially thought the odour was caused by a dead mouse.Two days after the deceased went missing, her decomposed body was found wrapped in bags and a blanket, underneath a bed.The court found her body had been moved from Amerika s room, to another area in the house.Sentencing proceedings against Amerika will get underway on Monday.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
