Increased police visibility and collaboration with private security at malls is aimed at curbing mall crimes this festive season. CAPE TOWN Business Against Crime says shopping malls in the Western Cape have bolstered security in preparation for a busy festive season.The organisation and police have dismissed hoax messages implying several shopping centres were robbed or under lockdown this week due to safety concerns.Police are, however, hunting suspects in connection with a cash-in-transit heist at N1 City Mall, an attempted robbery at Vangate Mall and a robbery at a bakery in Paarden Island on Wednesday. Most of the shopping centres have increased security complements and put other measures into place. They have briefed their staff on what to do if they are robbed. We are working closely with the South African Police Service, says Business Against Crime CEO Andrew Anthony.Meanwhile, Gauteng police commissioner Deliwe de Lange says several people have already been arrested at shopping malls across the province.De Lange says officers have been urged to take a proactive approach.She believes increased police visibility and partnerships with metros, the traffic department and private security have led to a drop in crime despite an expected spike at this time of the year. If I can tell you about the successes that we have in the malls, you would be shocked. &quot;We have arrested more than 10 people with unlicensed firearms around the malls. &quot;We have also arrested people in possession of jammers that they use to jam cars around the malls. Before the crime could be committed we managed to arrest the suspect. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
