What&#8217;s got teachers really upset is that other civil servants like the police and soldiers will be paid before Christmas. HARARE - Teachers on the Zimbabwe government s payroll are furious after the authorities published this month s pay schedule, showing they will only get their money after Christmas.The authorities have paid civil servants late on repeated occasions this year because of cash shortages, but there were hopes that things might be different for Christmas.What s got teachers really upset is that other civil servants like the police and soldiers will be paid before Christmas.The Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe says educators are being short-changed and abused by the government.State media is presenting this in a different light though, saying that the teachers will at least get their pay this month, even if it is three days after Christmas.This is actually the third year running teachers haven t been paid before 25 December and it comes after several months of delays in salary deposits.There s still no word on when annual bonuses will be paid and that s adding to teachers worries.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
