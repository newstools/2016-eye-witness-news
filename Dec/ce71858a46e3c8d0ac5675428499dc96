The teaching union has refuted claims it's captured the education system. CAPE TOWN The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) has refuted claims it's captured the education system.Union representatives, along with Basic Education Department officials, briefed Members of Parliament (MPs) on the so-called 'jobs for cash' report on Wednesday.An investigation was launched following allegations that some Sadtu officials have been selling teaching posts.The union's Mugwena Maluleke has slammed the allegations. Sadtu can t be blamed for being a majority organisation. The fact that we are the majority means that we work as an organisation. Teachers have a reason to join Sadtu. We can t be blamed for that. We have not captured the Department of Education. The Federation of Governing Bodies' Paul Colditz says some union members do try to influence processes. There are union observers who deliberately try to derail the process to promote the chances of their own members. That is a fact. It is wider than reported. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
