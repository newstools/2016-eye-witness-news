JOHANNESBURG - As the Transport Minister Dipuo Peters deplores dangerous drivers and unroadworthy vehicles at the start of the festive season traffic rush, the Gauteng Health Department says its growing increasingly concerned about road safety.Hospital staff across the province have already treated more than 2,000 people since the start of December.Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu says Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital has treated 949 of these cases, while Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital has attended to 468. Mahlangu says these trauma cases include vehicle and pedestrian accidents as well as stabbings and gunshots.She has urged residents and visitors to be careful on the roads. The numbers across the province will go beyond 2,000 and we want to appeal to South Africans that as you drive on the road, think about other drivers and your family members. Meanwhile, Peters says she is stunned by the condition of some vehicles on South Africa s roads and drivers who disregard road rules will face the full might of the law. It is surprising to find the kind of vehicles coming to fill up petrol and the conditions of those vehicles. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
