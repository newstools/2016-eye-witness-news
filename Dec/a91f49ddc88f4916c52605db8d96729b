The comments come as Parliament prepares to oppose Mbulaheni Maguvhe's interdict of the ad-hoc committee probing the SABC board's fitness to hold office. CAPE TOWN - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has slammed South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe for what it calls a disrespect of Parliament.The trade union federation is making submissions during Parliamentary hearings on the 2016 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, where its suggested government intervene timeously in troubled state entities.The comments come as Parliament prepares to oppose Maguvhe's interdict of the ad-hoc committee probing the SABC board's fitness to hold office.Cosatu's parliamentary coordinator Matthew Parks says: We have a very bizarre situation in Parliament, where one SABC board member is trying to challenge Parliament authority to intervene on governance. Parks adds the trade union federation hopes a proposed Shareholder Management Bill could be made into law. That s going to help government to intervene properly around the SOEs, because at times they seem to view themselves as independent of government and not accounting to government.
