An economist says that the change in outlook is a warning sign for the state-owned enterprise. JOHANNESBURG - Economists say ratings agency Fitch s latest decision to change its outlook for Eskom from stable to negative is hardly surprising as the country s sovereign rating also remains bleak.On Thursday Fitch cited a lack of certainty around government s promised financial support of Eskom.South Africa has managed to avoid junk status for now but remains at risk of a downgrade.
