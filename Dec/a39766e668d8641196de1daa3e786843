JOHANNESBURG - The City of Joburg says it will continue to remove any road restrictions erected around gated communities without municipal approval.Last week, the city announced it had removed some unauthorised road access restrictions in Hurlingham Manor North due to non-compliance by residents.The city claims that the access controls are not in accordance with its security policies and may infringe on other residents' right of movement. But the Hurlingham North Residents Association says the community has always followed policy and procedure. The city's Lisa Steftel says proper processes need to be adhered to. They have to get majority support from all people that live or work in the particular area. They also need to be able to ask them to do a traffic impact assessment, to look at the impact of traffic restrictions if the roads are closed and police have to prove that there is a need for it.&quot;(Edited by Neo Koza)
