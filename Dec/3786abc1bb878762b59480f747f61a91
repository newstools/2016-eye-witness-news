At least one political analyst believes the Guptas are attempting to reconsolidate their businesses outside South Africa. JOHANNESBURG Duduzane Zuma s continued use of the Gupta family's private plane to travel between South Africa and Dubai, has raised questions about whether the controversial family is reconsolidating their business interests outside of the country.Eyewitness News has flight records showing that President Jacob Zuma s son arrived at Lanseria Airport on the private jet on 7 November, from Dubai, and several other times since his resignation from Oakbay Investments.In April this year, Zuma along with two Gupta brothers went public by resigning and distancing themselves from Oakbay Investments citing concerns for the company s future due to the political aspersions cast on their involvement.Zuma also stood out as a central figure in the Public Protector s State of Capture report, as the Gupta family facilitator and one of the people who took Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas to a meeting where he was offered Nhlanhla Nene s job as finance minister.Since Duduzane Zuma relinquished all positions he held at Oakbay he has used the Gupta private plane to enter and exit the country five times.Flight ZS-Oak left from Lanseria for Dubai once, and landed in Lanseria four times between April and November this year.On 31 July, Zuma was on board the Gupta plane that landed in South Africa, this time with well-known Gupta associate Salim Essa.Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says it appears the Guptas are attempting to reconsolidate their businesses outside of South Africa. This still raises concern because we know majority of the businesses are funded through the Public Investment Corporation, through the text payers money. Mathekga says using the Guptas plane indicates that Zuma may still have strong ties with the family. It should make us worry so much because first of all the grave offence by the Guptas is to use the taxpayer's money through their relationship with Jacob Zuma and Duduzane Zuma, to build a very controversial business empire in South Africa. But now we are going to the second level which involves the repatriation of South African capital outside South Africa. But Professor Sipho Seepe disagrees. Just because people have not worked together, does not mean there might not be any other relationship beyond that. The president s son says he resigned from Oakbay to preserve jobs, saying that despite his efforts to participate meaningfully in the economy aspirations were cast against him and his family.Zuma, the Guptas and Oakbay have been unavailable for comment.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
