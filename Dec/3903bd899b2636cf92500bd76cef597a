President Jacob Zuma says he will never resign, saying that he would be surrendering himself to white monopoly capital. JOHANNESBURG - It s being argued that President Jacob Zuma s remarks that he will not resign shows the intensity of divisions in the party and how leaders are fighting for political control.Zuma made the remarks while addressing an African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) lecture in Durban in his capacity as party president.He told the gathering that he will never resign, saying he would be surrendering himself to white monopoly capital.In November, some of President Zuma s comrades in the ANC NEC called on him to bow out and there have also been increasing calls outside the party from civil society organisations and some of the party s veterans.But the president has one issue with all these people. Tell me what is it that I have done wrong? And when I ask them, they run out of answers. Political analyst Dumisani Hlophe said: These are groups within the ANC and outside the ANC that are fighting for the control of the state. Those who have made the calls have mentioned issues like the Nkandla Constitutional Court judgement, the party s electoral decline and the president s involvement in the State of Capture report as reasons why they want him to resign.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
