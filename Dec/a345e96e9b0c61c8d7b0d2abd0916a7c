Lawyer Gert van der Merwe says that the Gupta family is convinced that its Oakbay bank accounts were closed without good reason. JOHANNESBURG - The lawyer representing the Guptas says the family maintains that their accounts with the four major banks were closed without good reason.Gert van der Merwe was reacting to financial institution Absa s affidavit filed this week supporting Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s application for a declaratory order confirming that he is not permitted to interfere in the decisions of banks concerning their client relationships.The bank revealed in court papers that it cut ties with the Gupta family because there was evidence of large unexplained transfers of funds from Oakbay companies and that the Gupta company was not using Absa as a primary bank and that the family was planning on moving their banking business to alternative financial institutions. Van der Merwe says the family is convinced the bank accounts were closed without good reason.&quot;It is unfortunate that the accounts were closed and they still maintain that the accounts were closed without good reason.&quot;(Edited by Zunaid Ismael)
