CAPE TOWN The African National Congres s (ANC) has laid a complaint with the Human Rights Commission, against a Cape Town woman, who apparently made racist remarks on Facebook.The party says it was offended by Vanessa Hartley s post, in which she says too many Africans are flocking to Hout Bay .In the post Hartley likens Africans to animals who should be tied to a rope .She also urges residents to draw up a petition. But the ANC s Yonela Diko says such comments will not be tolerated. We reject this kind of sentiment from Vanessa Hartley, but we must state that we refuse to accept that this province is tragically bound to the evil of racism. Hartley has since apologised for her Facebook post.She claims she left her cellphone unattended at a bar over the weekend and that someone else must have posted the statement on her account.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
