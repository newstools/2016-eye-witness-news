The Department Environmental Affairs says they have found farmers, vets, police and even government officials implicated in rhino poaching. JOHANNESBURG The Environmental Affairs Department says it acknowledges that corruption on various levels has compromised its efforts in the fight against rhino poaching. The department s Albi Modise says they have in separate incidents found farmers, vets, police and even government officials implicated in rhino poaching. He says they can attribute the progress they have made in lowering the number of rhinos killed this year to the cooperation they have had with the Hawks, police and other organisations.Modise says the partnerships have resulted in almost a 100 less rhino being killed by September where the figure stood at over 700. At all times, the Hawks have been helpful in terms of making sure that when we find individuals to be involved or to be working with the syndicate, they flush out of the system as always, and it has happened before where some police officials have been arrested.
