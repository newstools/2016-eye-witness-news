JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the formation of his party and its policies were inspired by the late Fidel Castro and he s told supporters that when the red berets take over government they will make the country exactly like Cuba.Malema was speaking at the party s memorial service for the late Cuban president who died last week at the age of 90.He says through his socialist policies, Castro brought unemployment in Cuba down to 3% and hiked literacy levels to 93%.Malema also praised Castro for his role in liberating South Africa. If it was not because of Fidel Castro, most African countries were not going to be liberated. It was the people of Cuba who deliberately came to help African people to liberate themselves. Malema says only the EFF has the right to celebrate Castro s life and not the African National Congress as it hasn t achieved anything that comes close to what he did.WATCH: Looking back at Fidel Castro's controversial legacy(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
