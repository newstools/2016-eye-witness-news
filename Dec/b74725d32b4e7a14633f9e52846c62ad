Phahlane was speaking during a visit to the Mall of Africa in Midrand on Thursday afternoon.He says the aim of the police's Back to Basics initiative is to assist people in going about their shopping peacefully. Phahlane says it s quite clear that this time of the year usually sees increased criminal activity. He says the Back to Basics project is not just about heightening security but it also gives the police the opportunity to interact with communities. For obvious reasons, the Mall of Africa is a centre of attraction thus we have deployed more members here. Phahlane says police are also working with various stakeholders to insure the project is rolled out efficiently. I came with the leadership of the police form the headquarters and we also use an opportunity like this one to interact communities. Police say almost 2,000 trainees have been deployed throughout the province of Gauteng.
