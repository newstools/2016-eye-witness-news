CAPE TOWN - Police dive units are still searching for two people presumed to have drowned along the False Bay coast.They are looking for an 18-year-old from Gugulethu who disappeared underwater while swimming with three other teenagers at Mnandi Beach.A man believed to be in his 30s also went missing at sea at Monwabisi beach on Monday. At the same time the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has warned beachgoers to be aware of strong rip currents.NSRI chief executive Cleeve Robertson says people should always try to swim where lifeguards can spot them. Always listen to the lifeguards and swim between the flags. I always feel sorry for them because they have a hard job and have to put up with a lot. Try and familiarise yourself with the signage on the beach so that you understand what a rip current is because it is a major problem on all the beaches. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
