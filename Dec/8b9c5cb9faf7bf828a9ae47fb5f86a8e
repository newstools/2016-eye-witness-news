JOHANNESBURG The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have called on South Africans to vote to unshackle the destiny of the country from the African National Congress (ANC). Yesterday, a celebration was held in Sharpeville to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, where a group of EFF members disrupted President Jacob Zuma's speech.The red berets say while they do celebrate this special occasion, they interrupted the celebration because both the ANC and Zuma have failed to uphold the Constitution.Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said, The democratic state has been a state that was based on the weave of the people. However, in the past five years of Zuma s regime, the ANC is the single most dangerous threat to the future of a democratic Constitutional order.
