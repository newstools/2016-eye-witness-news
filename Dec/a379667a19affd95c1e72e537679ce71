The political party has come out in defence of suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega. JOHANNESBURG The Congress of the People (Cope) says government wants to make suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega the scapegoat and use her to cover-up for senior leaders in government, when it comes to the Marikana massacre.The organisation is calling for the police portfolio committee in Parliament to establish an inquiry into Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and the then police minister Nathi Mthethwa s involvement in Marikana.The party s Dennis Bloem says minister Mthethwa must tell the country who gave the national commissioner the instruction to use live ammunition and to order hearses to the koppie.Bloem says the involvement of Ramaphosa, who was then the non-executive member of the Lonmin board, cannot be disputed and it s unfair to make Phiyega solely responsible for everything that happened at Marikana. These people were also involved in that massacre. We are saying it can t only be Riah Phiyega who is held responsible. She was taking instructions from a political head, Nathi Mthethwa.
