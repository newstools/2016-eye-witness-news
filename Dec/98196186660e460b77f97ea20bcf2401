XK pic.twitter.com/F7PyCh85PfThe court on Tuesday granted a draft order that police management provide outstanding documents to the pair.In June, Veary was moved to Cape Town cluster commander while Jacobs was re-assigned to Wynberg.Veary says the pair will argue the transfers are against fair labour practices and were irrational. In our law, the motive with which we do something, and labour law must be clearly declared and be consonant with what happens just subsequently. That is what we're saying wasn't there. Veary says their suspicion as to why they were removed will be set out during arguments in court.SAPS management maintains due process was followed in the re-deployment .(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
