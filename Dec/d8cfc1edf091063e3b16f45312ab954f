AmaBhungane says the Gupta family was able to control who got major contracts from Transnet and then charged Neotel a massive fee to get important contracts. JOHANNESBURG - The amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism says it believes the Gupta family was able to control who got major contracts from Transnet and then charge the phone operator Neotel a massive fee to get important contracts.It also says it has proof the Guptas have been involved in money-laundering and used a series of letter-box firms to get the money out of the country.Several months ago court documents revealed R6.8 billion moved by the Guptas had been flagged by the Financial Intelligence Centre as suspicious. AmaBhungane s Stefaans Brummer says they were able to track how many went from Neotel to a letterhead company called Homix, and Neotel then got a Transnet contract. Behind a lot of other money also flowing through Homix onwards to uncertain destinations, some of it we saw coming to a company in Hong Kong which shared an address with companies belonging to a Gupta associate. LISTEN: Guptas use groups of companies to launder moneyAnd he says it doesn t make sense that Homix would be paid R42 million when it doesn t have any particular expertise or a proper headquarters. A company that as we found hidden behind a blue door next to the gents in a rundown office block. The Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
