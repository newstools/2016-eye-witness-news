Providers including Vodacom, Orange and Airtel have not commented on whether they will comply. JOHANNESBURG Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have asked telecoms companies to block social media networks from Monday, apparently to thwart protests against plans by President Joseph Kabila to stay in power.Providers including Vodacom, Orange and Airtel have not commented on whether they will comply but one industry executive says all companies have signed an agreement to respect national security injunctions.The government blocked social media networks and the internet during protests in January 2015 saying it was necessary to prevent rumours that could have fueled violence. The country s top court has extended Kabila s tenure beyond the end of his two-term limit in the wake of a deal between the government and some opposition leaders to delay a presidential vote until April 2018.
