Obviously [it is] quite traumatic because there is quite a lot of stuff that belonged to our grandparents and quite a lot of important paper work. FNB says affected customers will be notified.Another affected bank user feels that trust has been broken. It s a trust relationship. I wouldn t bring whatever I am putting in there if I didn t trust the bank. Surely they need to take responsibility.
