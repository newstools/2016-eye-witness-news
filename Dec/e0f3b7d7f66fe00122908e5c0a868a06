The bank says after it closed bank accounts belonging to Gupta-linked companies, it&#8217;s become the victim of a public campaign. JOHANNESBURG Standard Bank says after it closed bank accounts belonging to Gupta-linked companies, it s become the victim of a wholesale public campaign including advertisements placed in the media to discredit it.These are some of the reasons listed by the bank in its High Court bid to prevent the president or any of his ministers from intervening in its decision. The bank submitted an affidavit to the High Court in Pretoria this week in support of an application by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who is seeking an order that he cannot interfere in the big four banks decisions to cut ties with the Guptas.Standard Bank has cited a number of reasons in its explosive affidavit on why it decided to close bank accounts belonging to Gupta-linked companies.In its affidavit, Standard Bank reportedly argues that ministerial threats to review South Africa s banking regulations and comments from Zuma that he is considering requests for a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the Gupta account closures have no legal basis. It s also apparently listed members of the Gupta family implicated in the Public Protector's State of Capture report as a great concern.It emerged in court papers filed by Gordhan in October that members of the controversial family and companies they control have been involved in suspicious transactions worth R6.8 billion.While Standard Bank has refused to comment further, the Presidency says it still hasn t heard from its lawyers regarding the matter.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
