JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has called on his supporters to honour the late former President of Cuba, Fidel Castro, by taking the land they want.Malema addressed the party s memorial service held for Castro in Soweto on Thursday. He appeared in court last month for making similar remarks in Newcastle and Bloemfontein. Both cases were postponed.Malema says one of the reasons Cuba is a better country is because Castro took the land and gave it to its rightful owners.He has called on his supporters to honour him properly. That s the only way you can honour Fidel Castro, take your land because it belongs to you. He also used the opportunity to send this message to white people. We have no guns. We do not threaten to shoot you, we re asking for you to return the land to its rightful owners. He told his supporters to stop being cowards who suck up to white people.UNEMPLOYMENT, ILLITERACY &amp; DRUG ABUSE Malema says white people are responsible for unemployment, illiteracy and drug abuse amongst black people and has warned that if they don t return what belongs them, there will be an outburst.Malema says white people have damaged the lives of black people. We re unemployed because of them. We re dying of diseases because of them. We re illiterate because of them. We ve surrendered to drugs because of you. You owe us a lot. He says if whites don t return what belongs to blacks, there will be problems. One day we re going to have an outburst. He told his supporters to speak out freely about whites and the land and never to feel like they owe whites an apology.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
