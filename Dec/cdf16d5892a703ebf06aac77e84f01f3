An unknown group of men overpowered a guard before breaking into the restricted area where the boxes were held on the weekend. JOHANNESBURG FNB has declined to confirm just how many safety deposit boxes were stolen in a weekend heist in which robbers used a grinder to cut through a wall of its Randburg branch and held a security guard hostage. An unknown group of men overpowered the guard before breaking into the restricted area where the boxes were held.The financial service provider says it will be working closely with authorities during the investigation.FNB is also yet to disclose the value of the goods inside the boxes.The Hawks's Ndivhuwo Mulamu says it s too early to speculate on whether the crime was an inside job. We have to let the investigation be conducted to really get into the matter to what happened at the crime scene and who are those suspects. One customer believes the bank must bear some responsibility for this robbery. I still feel the bank needs to get to the bottom of this because this now is a trust relationship that has been broken. Customers who were victims of the heist have expressed outrage at the poor communication from FNB on the issue.One woman says: If I hadn t phoned to make an appointment, I wouldn t have known that my box had been stolen. Another customer added: What is more irritating is the fact that this apparently happened between Saturday night and Sunday morning and we were only notified this (Wednesday) morning. The Randburg FNB branch will remain closed until further notice as police investigate a case of business robbery. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
