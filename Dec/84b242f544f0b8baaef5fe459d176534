CAPE TOWN - The National Treasury has confirmed it sent the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) five letters requesting documents relating to a contentious studio tender but then board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe simply ignored them.Treasury was commenting on an alleged irregular tender awarded to a company called Vision View worth nearly R40 million to refurbish SABC studios.In terms of Treasury regulations, deviations from normal tender procedures need to be approved.At the same time, the president s office has said it will wait for a parliamentary committee to conclude its investigations into the SABC board s fitness to hold office before appointing an interim board.The SABC board finally ceased to exist following the resignation of Maguvhe on Monday.The rest of the members had already vacated their positions, with two resigning in public while testifying before the portfolio committee on communications.The Presidency has announced that it will wait for the report of the ad-hoc parliamentary committee on the fitness of the board to hold office, expected in February 2017.Then the National Assembly will make recommendations to the president on candidates for an interim board.The president will then have 10 days to establish the board.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
