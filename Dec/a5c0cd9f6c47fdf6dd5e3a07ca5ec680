McBride yesterday chose not to present himself to Hawks investigators to provide a warning statement. JOHANNESBURG The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has likened Robert McBride s charges to those faced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, saying the Hawks are not acting in the interests of justice.On Monday, McBride chose not to present himself to Hawks investigators to provide a warning statement as part of an investigation against him for defeating or obstructing the ends of justice.The probe relates to two incidents during his term as Ekurhuleni Metro Police Chief, almost a decade ago.McBride believes telephonic recordings that emerged earlier this month suggesting Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and senior Hawks investigators had been conspiring to find 'any dirt against hime' have everything to do with him being investigated for defeating the ends of justice.The Ipid head says he is being treated just like the Hawks treated Gordhan.His spokesperson Moses Dlamini says, The manner in which this matter has been pursued against Mr. McBride is similar to the manner in which to that of finance minister. He says it s questionable that it s the Hawks investigating the charge of defeating the ends of justice because it s not a priority crime that falls within the mandate of the directorate for priority crime investigations.Dlamini says the action by the Hawks is related to Ipid s decision last week to take a warning statement from Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza. The Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza threatened that the Hawks would also be taking a statement from Ipid investigators. Dlamini has also questioned why the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations Unit is investigating a charge of defeating the ends of justice. The charge of defeating the ends of justice is not a priority crime that falls within the mandate of the Hawks. He says McBride has taken legal advice against appearing before the Hawks and has accused the directorate of not acting in the interests of justice.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
