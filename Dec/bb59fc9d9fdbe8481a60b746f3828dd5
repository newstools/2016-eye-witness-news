Earlier this month the veterans rejected the party&#8217;s decision to hold the consultative gathering alongside the policy conference in 2017. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwarts say they have asked for a meeting with the party in the new year aimed at finalising details of the consultative conference.Earlier this month the veterans rejected the party s decision to hold the consultative gathering alongside the policy conference next year.The national executive council decided that the first two days of that conference would be dedicated to assessing the state of the party, but the stalwarts want the consultative conference to be held separately, with the involvement of civil society organisations.They've previously raised concerns about what they call the deteriorating state of the ANC under President Jacob Zuma.One of the stalwarts is the Reverend Frank Chikane who says, It's just a matter of agreeing on the details; who is going to facilitate it, and we talked about the committee of veterans who we are going to make available to deal with this matter.
