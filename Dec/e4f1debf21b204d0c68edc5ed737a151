YCLSA's Mluleki Dlelanga says this has resulted in the revolution being on the verge of being hijacked if it hasn't been already. JOHANNESBURG - The Young Communist League of South Africa (YCLSA) says corruption and gatekeeping in the African National Congress (ANC) has led to big business capturing key leaders.The league s national secretary Mluleki Dlelanga says this has resulted in the revolution being on the verge of being hijacked if this has not happened already.The youth wing of the SACP held its third national council declaration in Soweto this weekend.Dlelanga says in every liberation movement there comes a point where it becomes inward looking and forgets about the people and says this is where the ANC is.He says once leaders forget that the purpose is to serve the people and start serving themselves then the revolution because sensitive to hijacking. The revolution gets hijacked because these leaders are supposed to make policies and implement them in the interest of the people. But if that revolution is hijacked, then it is the people who will suffer out of that. In a similar fashion just days ago, South African Communist Party leader Solly Mapaila said his party was not going to defend any attempts to capture the state by corporates or the likes of the Gupta and Rupert families.The league says a consultative conference to resolve the factionalism and corruption within the ANC could be the best chance the party has.It says the ANC has been through a similar situation during the struggle where the late struggle hero Chris Hani and other members wrote a memorandum and the subsequent Morogoro.The YCLSA says in every liberation movement there comes a point where it becomes inward looking and forgets about the people and circumstance the ANC is currently faced with. Dlelanga said, For instance in each conference of the ANC, there are two groups contesting each other in a very clumsy way of handling things and which results in another group which forms their own organisation.
