Professor John Stremlau says the Tshwane ANC caucus is overreacting in its response to the visit by the Tshwane mayor. JOHANNESBURG - A visit by Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga to Taiwan is continuing to draw reaction from various quarters.Wits University s international relations professor John Stremlau says the Tshwane African National Congress (ANC) caucus is overreacting in its response.Msimanga is currently in Taiwan following an invitation to meet the mayor of the country s capital city of Taipei to explore possible investment opportunities.However, the Tshwane ANC caucus says it is contradicting South Africa s position on the One China policy.Stremlau says he doesn t believe the visit is a big problem. I do want to draw attention to the ANC s overreaction, at least the Tshwane caucus. I think there s something more serious going on here and that s investments that may be possible and flowing from relationships with Taiwan at the economic level.
