Nehawu says President Zuma&#8217;s resignation and replacement by Cyril Ramaphosa would be the start of uniting the ANC. JOHANNESBURG - Public sector union National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) says President Jacob Zuma s resignation and replacement by his Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa would be the start of uniting the African National Congress (ANC). Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)'s biggest affiliate held a briefing earlier on Thursday following its Central Executive Committee meeting. The union was the first to call on the president to step down and while Cosatu agreed to back Ramaphosa, it didn't take a position on the calls for President Zuma to resign. Nehawu believes there is only one way to fix and unite the ANC. Secretary General Bereng Soke says: We maintain that the first way forward is for the ANC to develop a unifying roadmap towards the 54th National Conference and with Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa steering the transition to an overwhelming victory for the ANC in the 2019 national elections. He says if this happens all the problems facing the ANC would be resolved. The union believes the president is partly to blame for the factionalism and divisions in his party.Nehawu first deputy president Mike Shingane says: All we know is that there are many wrong things that have been done in the movement in his name. And our view is that that can t be done as the head of the organisation. At some point you need to step up and show leadership and if necessary tell the people not to do wrong things in your name.
