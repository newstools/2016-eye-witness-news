All of this looms for the matrics of 2016.On Friday, the Independent Examinations Board results were released with an overall pass rate of 98.67%.Head of academics at St John's College Anne Nettleton says they encourage their pupils not to leave the country to pursue their tertiary studies abroad. We don t want to educate our pupils to leave South Africa. At the same time, Redhill principal Joseph Gerassi says free education should only be provided to students who are academically deserving and can t afford to pay their fees. People that are wealthy need to pay for education, so we definitely have to make sure that people who cannot afford those fees are given free education.
