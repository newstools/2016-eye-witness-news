It says the minimum pass rate for mathematics between grades 7 and 9 remains at 40%. JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Basic Education says continued media reports that it has decided to change its progression policy for math to 20% are unfortunate and misleading.The department says there is no such thing as a 20% pass mark for the subject and there has been no change in procedure.It says the minimum pass rate for mathematics between grades 7 and 9 remains at 40%.The department says the current policy states that even if pupils pass all other subjects with distinctions, but get less than the threshold for maths, they fail the year.Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says they are now reviewing this rule because it has been unfair to those who do not want to pursue the maths from grade 10. People call this a 20%pass mark when we ve said it is not correct because that suggests there is a policy change; it suggests 20% is a pass when in fact it is a fail. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
