Visitors are now able to enjoy more convenience by purchasing their tickets from any Computicket outlet nationwide. JOHANNESBURG - The National Zoological Gardens in Pretoria has launched a new online ticketing system to ease the number of long queues at the park. This is the first zoo in South Africa to provide the service which will see visitors purchase tickets at stores and via Computicket. The park's Craig Allenby says there will also be additional safety measures introduced over the holiday season. The online ticketing system has been available from 1 December and has been very well received from our guests and I am sure it s going to make a really great enhancement to visitors through this December in our big season.
