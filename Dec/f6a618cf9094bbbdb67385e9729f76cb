Commissioner de Lange attributes the decrease to increased deployment and visibility by the police. JOHANNESBURG Gauteng Police Commissioner Deliwe de Lange says crime has decreased during this festive season as a result of proactive measures taken by police officers on the ground.The South African Police Service is working closely with metro police and the Gauteng traffic department to combat crime.Police have also been visible in malls and shopping centres across the province.De Lange says normally there s a spike in robberies and hijackings at this time of the year, but they have managed to ensure that there are more officers on the ground. She says hard work went into preparing a plan for the festive season. One of our best practices is visibility when we started with this season we received 2,000 police trainees. Before we started with the festive season we sat down with private security firms and shared all our best practices and the way forward on what it is that we can do to prevent crime in our malls. There are foot patrols all over the malls, roadblocks all over national roads and we have also improved our response to complaints due to increased deployments.&quot;We have achieved a lot of success in our fight against crime, it is showing a decline and we are happy.&quot;But we are not done and we are still continuing with these measures over the festive season. And while police have been particularly visible in malls and shopping centres across the province, shoppers are still being warned to stay vigilant in busy centres.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
