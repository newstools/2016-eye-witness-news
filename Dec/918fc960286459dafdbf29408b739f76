The NSPCA says it found two dogs engaged in a fight between rival kennel groups when its team arrived on scene.Some dogs were badly hurt which led to the NSPCA having to put them down.The council s senior inspector Wendy Wilson says, Where you have such an act of interest in a violent crime against vulnerables, you have an escalation of that violence into other societal avenues and networks.
