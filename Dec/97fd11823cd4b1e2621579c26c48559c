The ANC veterans say two days is not enough for a consultative conference to discuss issues plaguing the ruling party. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts say two days is not enough for a consultative conference to discuss and deal with what they call the evils that perpetrated the party, and want it to dedicate more time for the conference and separate it from the policy gathering.The stalwarts also want civil society organisations to be welcome. The veterans, who say they are concerned about the state of the ANC under President Jacob Zuma, held a press briefing on Tuesday following an earlier meeting with the party.They have, on three occasions, met with party leaders and managed to convince the ANC to hold a conference that would assess the state of the movement.The ANC has only dedicated two days for a consultative conference that would proceed the policy gathering.But the stalwarts say the allocated time is not enough to discuss all the challenges facing the organisation thoroughly.Stalwart Wally Serote says, We want time to go in-depth and have robust discussions. It s a serious matter so we must have time. The veterans have indicated they want civil society organisations, some of which are already at odds with the ANC, and other sectors of society to be part of the gathering discussing ANC issues because they believe the problems the party has caused have had wide ranging effects.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
