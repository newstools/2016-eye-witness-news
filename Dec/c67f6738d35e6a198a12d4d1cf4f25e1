This week the presidency said Zuma referred the Fica Bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. JOHANNESBURG Political analysts say government should adopt the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill in order to ensure transparency but say President Jacob Zuma may not want to be seen as making big decisions at this point.This week the presidency said Zuma referred the Fica Bill back to Parliament for reconsideration because he was concerned about the bill's constitutionality.It was passed by Parliament earlier this year. The draft legislation will require a senior bank official to approve the accounts of prominent influential persons and also oblige banks to establish the source of funds as well as monitor these accounts on a regular basis.Political analyst Benedict Dube says if Zuma had signed it, he would have put himself in a predicament. If he signs it, even himself he is supposed to be subjected to it. The South African politics are very polluted in terms of who are funding these politicians. Analyst Ralph Mathekga says Zuma s concern about an invasion of privacy may not be valid. They are overriding concerns in South Africa regarding the fact of money laundering. We ve recently been talking about some of the transactions involving the powerful Gupta family, so I think that politically the bill is a hot potato for him. The Fica Bill was passed in Parliament in May and submitted to Zuma for approval in June - he was supposed to sign it within a 30-day period.On Tuesday, the president's office issued a statement saying he considered the bill in its entirety but is referring it back to the National Assembly.One of Zuma s main concerns is the provisions relating to warrantless searches.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
