Ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith says he hopes proceedings will resume this week. CAPE TOWN - The Parliamentary ad hoc committee investigating the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board's fitness to hold office believes it can meet its deadline, despite being delayed by court action.The inquiry is expected to resume this week after the Western Cape High Court dismissed board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe's application to interdict the probe.The ad hoc committee lost three days of hearings last week because of Maguvhe's decision to approach the court.Ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith says he hopes proceedings will resume in two days time. What I can say is that we will definitely be working by Thursday and the best case scenario would be Wednesday. Smith adds he contacted Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, whose office has previously investigated the SABC, to confirm her availability to appear in Parliament.Mkhwebane is among about 30 witnesses who will make submissions at the committee's public hearings.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
