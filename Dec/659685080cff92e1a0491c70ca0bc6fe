Three inmates died as a result of an attack on prison officials at St Alban&#8217;s Correctional Centre in Port Elizabeth on Monday. CAPE TOWN The South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights (Sapohr) says revolts in the country s prisons won t stop until the rights of inmates have been addressed.Three inmates died as a result of an attack on prison officials at St Alban s Correctional Centre in Port Elizabeth on Monday. Sapohr president Golden Miles Bhudu says prison officials are complicit in the attacks because they are equally unhappy about their working conditions.Bhudu says the festive season is a popular time for inmates to protest. Gangsters are using this age-old tactic where they have to attack, they have to be rebellious, they have to protest in order to get attention.But Bhudu says the attack at St Alban s could have been avoided. &quot;This comes as negligence. This comes as ignorance of correctional officers, who have forgotten that they have a mandate to deal with human beings who have broken the law. Bhudu said prison officials are complicit in prison attacks. They are all involved in smuggling illegal objects and contraband into the institution and of course the leadership of the Department of Correctional Services has not worked day and night to bring an end to that quagmire. Bhudu said that keeping the St Alban's prison on lockdown was only a quick fix to the problem.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
