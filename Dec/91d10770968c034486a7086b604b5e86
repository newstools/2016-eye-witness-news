West Ham, who are 17th in the Premier League table, having scored 15 goals in 14 matches so far. LONDON - West Ham United manager Slaven Bilic has admitted his team need to improve in front of goal and praised Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge who has been linked with a move to the Premier League strugglers.West Ham, who travel to Anfield on Sunday, are 17th in the Premier League table, having scored 15 goals in 14 matches so far.&quot;The strikers didn't score enough goals or as many as we expected but it is not only down to them,&quot; Bilic told British media.&quot;I never want to divide the team into strikers and the rest. Although it is the strikers' job to score goals, it is also the responsibility of the whole team.&quot;West Ham have been linked with a move for Sturridge in the January transfer window, and Bilic said he admired the England international's natural ability.&quot;He's one of the biggest talents, he's a great player,&quot; the manager said.&quot;The talent is there, the touch, the finishing, everything is great. The only thing that's stopped him being regular for club and country are the injuries.&quot;Sturridge, who has lost his starting place to Brazilian Roberto Firmino under manager Juergen Klopp, will sit out Sunday's match with a calf injury, and Bilic would not confirm if he would bid for the striker in January.&quot;He's just a player that has been linked with us, basically, and we've been linked with almost every player,&quot; he said.&quot;We're always there in contention. Most of the time it's absolutely not true, 95 percent of the time. But you're asking me about Sturridge and I have no problem about that.&quot;All the clubs are thinking about him because he is that kind of player. I don't know his work rate, I don't know his dedication to his job or whatever but unfortunately for England and for Liverpool and especially for him he's injured. That's his problem.&quot;
