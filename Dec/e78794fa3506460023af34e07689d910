The bulk of them are coming back home, so it will be easy now for us to have a mobile solution which will help them to submit their applications. The department has warned that Lesotho citizens who fail to obtain a special permit to live and work in South Africa by March will be deported.Apleni says those in the country for business and academic reasons will not be spared if they are found to be in the country illegally.
