Minister Patel has highlighted strides made by government to expand the local automotive industry.He says many initiatives are being formulated and implemented by government to support local businesses, but adds these initiatives should be corruption free. We ve got to all be defenders of the Buy Local campaign. So when we see, whether its trains or T-shirts that government buys where the law is being broken bring it to our attention we don t know all the things. Patel has also called for collaboration between business and the public to steer the country away from recession. No one can predict, with full confidence, what will happen next year. It is our hope that the economy can avoid a recession. We are planning on that and we are working very hard for that we would like the union movement to join us in those efforts.
