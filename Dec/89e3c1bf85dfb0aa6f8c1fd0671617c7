JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma insists he s done nothing wrong and says resigning would only mean surrendering himself over to what he calls monopoly capital.Zuma told an African National Congress Youth League lecture in Durban on Wednesday night that he doesn t owe anyone an explanation.He was speaking in his capacity as African National Congress (ANC) president, a month after some national executive committee members called for him to step down.Since the Constitutional Court found that the president failed to uphold, respect and defend the Constitution over the Nkandla matter, Zuma has also been blamed for the ANC's electoral decline at the polls and he s faced criticism for his involvement in the state of capture report.These events became the breaking point for some in the ANC and outside the party to call on Zuma to do the honourable thing and resign.However, the president has told a gathering in Durban that s not going to happen. I will never, on my own, resign. If I did so, I would be surrendering to the monopoly capital , he said.The president used his address to pose a question to his audience, asking What is it that I have done wrong .
