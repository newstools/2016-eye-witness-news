SABC board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe wanted the court to set aside a subpoena to appear before a Parliamentary ad-hoc committee. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has dismissed SABC board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe s application to halt an inquiry into the board s fitness to hold office.Maguvhe wanted Judge Siraj Desai to set aside a subpoena to appear before the Parliamentary ad-hoc committee into the troubled public broadcaster. His lawyers argued the inquiry would be biased because some Members of Parliament (MPs) have already come to a pre-determined outcome.Desai had described the board as non-functional and non-existent with Maguvhe as the last man standing . Ad-hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith says the application was a waste of time. I don t think they had a leg to stand on. I think it was an exercise of delaying and the arguments raised by the applicants didn t have anything of substance. Smith adds he expects Maguvhe to abide by the court s ruling. I do expect the chair of the board and everybody who feels they might be adversely affected to be here to hear firsthand so they can t argue that they were spoken about in their absence.
