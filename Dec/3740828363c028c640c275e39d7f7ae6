JOHANNESBURG - The Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) says it will honour those who have contributed to the radical transformation of South Africa.The association s chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe says he's honouring individuals such as Hlaudi Motsoeneng, former Eskom boss Brian Molefe and South African Airways (SAA)'s board chairperson Dudu Myeni because they've changed the lives of South Africans, especially members of the MKMVA.Molefe is among those to be honoured by the MKMVA at its awards ceremony on Thursday.Maphatsoe explains why: Molefe has introduced a procurement policy that a certain percentage should go to members of the MKMVA. Maphatsoe says some of their members who have businesses are already benefiting from Eskom and have engaged with Myeni to also consider them.At the same time, Maphatsoe says the MKMVA is not interested in South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) politics, but will honour Motsoeneng under a special recognition category for his 90% local music in all SABC radio stations.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
