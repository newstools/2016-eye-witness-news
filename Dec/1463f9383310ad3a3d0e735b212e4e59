MEC for Transport Pat Ngomane the responsibility of dealing with the issue of drunk driving on the roads cannot rest solely with the traffic department. JOHANNESBURG - While just this week traffic officials have arrested close to 100 drunk drivers in Mpumalanga, the MEC for Transport Pat Ngomane says he congratulates law enforcement officials involved in dealing with the numerous accidents and cases of drunk driving this festive season. The MEC says that since the start of December, the province of Mpumalanga has recorded more than 100 road related deaths and close to 400 vehicle crashes. Ngomane has strongly expressed his disappointment with the high number of road crashes and says they are simply due to negligent motorists. He says that the responsibility of dealing with the issue of drunk driving on the roads cannot rest solely with the traffic department. People must be responsible and according to me, it must not be the responsibility of the law enforcement people. It must be the responsibility of everyone including the community members.
