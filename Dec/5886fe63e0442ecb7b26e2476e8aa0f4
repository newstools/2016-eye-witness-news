Not everyone is happy with the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association being granted the hosting rights for the parade. CAPE TOWN - Not everyone is happy with the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association (KKKA) being granted the hosting rights for the Tweede Nuwe Jaar Parade.The City of Cape Town approved the association's permit on Wednesday, as well as the Cape Malay Choir Board's permit to host the Nagtroepe event on Friday evening.The City's Eddie Andrews says: The KKKA has committed to organising an inclusive 2017 edition of the parade. We hope all minstrel organisations will work together to ensure the success of this important cultural highlight. But the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association that was also vying for the hosting rights, claims the KKKA did not get a risk grading certificate from South African Police Service and should therefore not have been given the permit.The Association's Kevin Momberg explains: We applied for the risk assessment and that s something that the national act requires to be done. We did all of this, discussed planning with the City s events office and police, now it comes to this. If this is how it goes in terms of national laws, we might as well throw the law out of the window. The city says the grading certificate is not required when it issues a permit and the KKKA will work with police.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
