The club owner, George Bopts, says he is still getting clarity from the bouncers who were there that evening. JOHANNESBURG A man who was turned away from Capital Underground Club in Rosebank for being in a wheelchair says he would like an apology from the club and a refund for his ticket. A 23-year-old man says he and a few of his friends went to the club this past weekend to celebrate a friend's matric dance after party when he was told by the bouncers at the door that he was not allowed to enter the club because he could not walk. The club owner, George Bopts, says he is still getting clarity from the bouncers, who were there that evening, on what exactly happened. The man, who was turned away from the club, says he was humiliated in front of people in the queue when he was made to stand up and demonstrate that he could walk. I stood up, and I stood up close to him. He told me no I am not going to let you in because of that , and pointed at my wheelchair. Bopts says the venue is a night club and is not obliged to cater to people in wheelchairs. When you get into our club, you have got to go all the way downstairs. The owner says although the man would have had trouble navigating his way inside the club it's strange the bouncers did not let him through even though he had a ticket.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
