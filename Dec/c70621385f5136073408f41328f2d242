The largest positive contributor to growth was mining and quarrying, which rose by 5.1%. JOHANNESBURG Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) says the economy grew at 0.2% in the third quarter. This is less than 3.5% in the last quarter.The largest positive contributor to growth was mining and quarrying, which rose by 5.1%.But growth within manufacturing contracted by 3.2%, with the agriculture, forestry and the fishing industry in decline for seven consecutive quarters.Economists had expected a quarter-on-quarter Gross Domestic Product expansion of 0.5%. Economist Thabi Leoka says the figure is much lower than expected. The main drag to the quarterly figure is the manufacturing sector which contracted by 3.2% versus an increase of 8.1% in the second quarter. So there was a big drag there. The recovery in the mining and quarrying sector contributed positively to third quarter growth largely due to higher production of iron ore.The lingering effects of the worst drought in decades also had a negative impact on the agricultural sector.Chief economist at Investment Solutions, Lesiba Motata, says the decline in trade was also disappointing. Which is really an expression of exports which were down 26% in the first quarter, showing that demand for South African goods was weaker. South Africa dodged a downgrade this month after Fitch, Moody s, Standard &amp; Poor s Global all affirmed its credit ratings but the agencies warned the country may be in line for a ratings review if the growth environment does not improve.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
