SABC board chaiperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe told MPs the he was persuaded by Ellen Tshabalala that Hlaudi Motsoeneng was doing a good job. CAPE TOWN - South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board chairperson Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe says he backed Hlaudi Motsoeneng for the post of permanent chief operating officer because he believed he was doing a sterling job. Maguvhe is testifying before Parliament's inquiry into the fitness of the SABC board to hold office.Initially Maguvhe told Members of Parliament he thought he voted for Motsoeneng s appointment unless the board s minutes stated otherwise. Unless I can be proven otherwise because from where I am, I think he does get things right. But he later claimed he was persuaded by then board chairperson Ellen Tshabalala under whose tenure the appointment was made. The argument put forward by the then chairperson convinced most of us, myself included, that the COO was doing a sterling job. Maguvhe says that at the time they were not aware the Public Protector s remedial actions were binding.He s also faced questions on why he should not be personally liable for the legal bill for trying to interdict the inquiry.He s added that he d rate himself an eight out of 10 for performance.At the same time, the board chairperson says he s unaware of any money being squandered at the public broadcaster, that he s never met with the Guptas and that the only problem with the board is that it lacks members.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
