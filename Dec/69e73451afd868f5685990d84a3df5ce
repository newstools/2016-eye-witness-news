Committee chair Humphrey Maxegwana says people involved in illegal tender activities at the public broadcaster should &#8216;face the law&#8217;. JOHANNESBURG The chairperson of Parliament s communication committee says if new fraud allegations involving former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Hlaudi Motsoeneng are true then heads must roll .Eyewitness News is in possession of documents and board minutes released by a whistle-blower which purportedly show how a legitimate tender for refurbishing a studio was abruptly cancelled and awarded to a company called Vision View.The price for the refurbishment appears to be grossly over-inflated.It's alleged finance managers who attempted to bring the procurement irregularities to the board s attention were suspended.Committee chair Humphrey Maxegwana says people involved in illegal tender activities at the public broadcaster should face the law . If those things are true then there is a lot that needs to be done in correcting those things and to put the standing of the SABC to what South Africans need [sic]. At the same time, member of the ad-hoc committee tasked with probing the fitness of the SABC board Makhosi Khoza says she s not aware of the allegations. We are not aware and I don t think the committee collectively know because such documents were never tabled to us. We have never seen anything of that sort. SOS CALLS FOR STRONG ACTION IN ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUDCivic organisation Save Our SABC (SOS) says the interim board that will be appointed at the public broadcaster needs to take strong action against those implicated in corrupt business.Mbulaheni Maguvhe, the last remaining non-executive board member, resigned on Monday.The SOS has been responding to claims contained in documents that show alleged tender irregularities involving Motsoeneng.The SOS s Kate Skinner says this is not the first time similar claims have come to light. I think that the issue is really around particular individuals actually being held to account. I think there need to be clear recommendations and then further investigation and particular individuals being held specifically to account and having to pay back money. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
