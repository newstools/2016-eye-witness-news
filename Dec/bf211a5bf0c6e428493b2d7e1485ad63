Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu the department has realised that the distance from the people needs to be reduced. JOHANNESBURG Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu says her department is building ambulance bases closer to townships and informal settlements to cut down the time it takes to respond to emergencies.Mahlangu was launching a new fleet of 60 ambulances in Orange Farm, south of Johannesburg.She says apart from continuously adding to the fleet of ambulances the department has realised that the distance from the people needs to be reduced.The MEC says in the past ambulances were only based at fire stations, and because not all communities have stations some areas had no ambulances close to them.She says coupled with improving the proximity, the ambulances have been fitted with technology similar to the Uber service, which are able to pin point exactly where the caller is. Now we are deliberately building EMS bases outside of the fire stations because you don t have fire stations all over in the township. So having EMS bases in the township, or closer to where people are, is a very important thing. However, Mahlangu says the roads in between shacks in the informal settlements remain a problem for them.WATCH: Gauteng health launches new ambulance(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
