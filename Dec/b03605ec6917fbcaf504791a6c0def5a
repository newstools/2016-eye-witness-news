JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng traffic police say they will continue operations at major taxi ranks across the province in a move to clamp down on unroadworthy vehicles. There has been a substantial increase in the number of road fatalities since the start of this month. At least 845 people have been killed on the country's roads. While a number of drivers have been arrested for failing to carry their licenses, 38 minibus taxis have been impounded over the past two days. The traffic police's Busaphi Nxumalo says: We re going to continue to deploy our officers on all the major taxi ranks in the province, to ensure that all public transport vehicles leaving the ranks are roadworthy. We re tired of seeing people dying on our roads. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
