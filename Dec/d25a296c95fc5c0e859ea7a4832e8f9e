Some 25,000 people have been evacuated from the rebel-held enclave of Aleppo since Thursday, the ICRC said. GENEVA - Some 25,000 people have been evacuated from the rebel-held enclave of Aleppo since Thursday, including 15,000 on Monday and 10,000 last Thursday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday.Teams from the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, who are leading the evacuation, were working through the night on Monday, ICRC spokeswoman Krista Armstrong told Reuters.The rebel withdrawal from Aleppo after a series of rapid advances by the army and allied Shi'ite militias including Hezbollah since late November has brought President Bashar al-Assad his biggest victory of the civil war.However, despite the capture of Aleppo and progress against insurgents near Damascus, the fighting is still far from over, with large areas remaining in rebel control in the northwestern countryside and in the far south.The jihadist group Islamic State also controls swathes of territory in the deserts and Euphrates river basin in eastern Syria.
