Water and Sanitation Department&#8217;s Sputnik Ratau says dam levels are way below what they were a year ago. JOHANNESBURG As the holiday season kicks into gear, the Water and Sanitation Ministry has appealed to South Africans and holiday makers to use water sparingly.The department says although the country has experienced some rains recently, this has not been sufficient enough to fill up all dams and reservoirs.The department s Sputnik Ratau says dam levels are way below what they were a year ago. Catchment areas have not collected as much water as we d have wanted them to. Therefore, the rain that falls doesn t not flow into the rivers that we require. Ratau says the rains in Johannesburg and Pretoria have not helped fill up the Vaal river system. Most of the rain that falls around Johannesburg and Pretoria doesn t flow into the Vaal Dam and the Vaal River system but it flows into ultimately the Hartbeespoort Dam, through the Crocodile, Jukskei River and so on. It s all those things that sometimes confuses the issue with people saying they see the rainfall but still the water restrictions remain. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
