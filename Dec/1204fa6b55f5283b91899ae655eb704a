JOHANNESBURG The Police Department says it s determined to ensure a tragedy like Marikana never happens again and aims to create a more people-centred service.The Presidency on Sunday issued an update on steps taken by government to implement the Farlam Commission of Inquiry s recommendations.Several senior police officials have been charged with attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice and ignoring advice of experienced public order police on crowd control.The department has given itself until 2019 to transform the service, which includes providing adequate training, demilitarising SAPS and making it more professional.Police spokesperson Sandile Ngidi says government is ready to compensate the families. Government is just finalising with lawyers the finer details of the compensation. But in general, government is ready and of course one needs to also give the plaintiffs to look at the offers and respond. Forty-four people, including 34 miners, were killed during a wage dispute at Lonmin mine in Marikana four years ago.Earlier this year, the government appointed an actuary to calculate all claims, most of which are those of the loss of support in favour of the deceased.About 275 unlawful arrest claims have been completed and are now ready for settlement, with only one claimant who has charges pending.Personal injury claims have been delayed due to the victims attorney still considering to agree on one set of medical experts.The Presidency says it is prepared to compensate the claims once all due processes have been completed.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
