The Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association has decided its 36 troupes will not be marching in the annual parade on Monday. CAPE TOWN Tweede Nuwejaar parade hosts say they are disappointed with the division among some of the minstrel associations.The Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association (CTMCA) has decided its 36 troupes will not be marching in the annual parade on Monday.This comes after the City of Cape Town granted the hosting rights for the parade to the Kaapse Klopse Karnivaal Assosiasie (KKKA) earlier this week.The CTMCA claims they have been side-lined by the municipality due to a political agenda, but the city has denied this. The KKKA was the only association to apply for a permit to host the event on 2 January, which was the most suitable date for the municipality.The KKKA's Muneeb Gambeno says they are disappointed that the CTMCA has turned down their invitation to join the parade on more than one occasion. Ultimately the carnival is owned by the people of Cape Town and the participants all look forward to the climate of the carnival. They want to participate and are prepared for it and for us to sow division amongst the people that we proclaim to serve is absolutely disappointing.
