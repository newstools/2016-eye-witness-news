Zuma has continued to use the Guptas' private jet to travel between South Africa and Dubai, even after resigning from Oakbay Investments. JOHANNESBURG - Concerns have been raised about Duduzane Zuma s current relationship with the controversial Gupta family and whether businesses established in South Africa are being reconsolidated in Dubai.Eyewitness News on Thursday revealed that the president s son has continued to use the Guptas private jet to travel between South Africa and Dubai, even after resigning from Oakbay Investments and distancing himself from the family.Between April and November, Zuma used the Guptas private jet five times and on 31 July he was on board with well-known Gupta associate Salim Essa.Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says it would appear that Zuma has not cut ties with the Guptas. The grave offence by the Guptas is to use the taxpayers money through their relationship with Jacob Zuma and Duduzane Zuma to build a very controversial business empire in South Africa. But now we are getting to the second level which involves the repatriation of South African capital. But fellow analyst Sipho Seepe says there s not enough evidence to prove something untoward is happening. He has resigned from a business relationship with the family but the fact that one is seen with the family does not necessarily make any bad maybe relationships. But I don t think there is sufficient information to suggest that he had actually lied. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
