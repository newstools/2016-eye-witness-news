The police watchdog says charges being investigated against Robert McBride do not fall within the Hawks&#8217;s mandate. JOHANNESBURG The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has questioned why the Hawks are investigating a charge of defeating the ends of justice, involving its head Robert McBride, as this does not fall within the mandate of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations.McBride declined to appear at the Hawks offices this morning to provide a warning statement, despite being ordered to do so as part of an investigation into defeating the ends of justice.The probe concerns two incidents which occurred during his term as Ekurhuleni Metro police chief nearly a decade ago.Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini says the action by the Hawks is related to Ipid s decision last week to take a warning statement from Hawks head General Berning Ntlemeza. The Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza threatened that the Hawks would also be taking a statement from Ipid investigators. Dlamini has also questioned why the directorate for priority crime investigations unit is investigating a charge of defeating the ends of justice. The charge of defeating the ends of justice is not a priority crime that falls within the mandate of the Hawks. He says McBride has taken legal advice against appearing before the Hawks and has accused the directorate of not acting in the interests of justice.
