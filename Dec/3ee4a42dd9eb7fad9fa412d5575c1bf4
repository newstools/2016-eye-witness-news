The Independent Institute of Education s Nola Payne says the holidays will be a bittersweet time for matriculants families who suspect their results are not likely to meet expectations.Payne warns the way adults manage the next few days, and ultimately their responses when the results are revealed, can significantly impact on the resilience of matriculants following a disappointment. First you need to tell them that the results don t determine who they are, it was a short period in their lives where they wrote matric and it doesn t mean that the rest of their future is now determined by those results that they get. Payne is urging parents and caregivers to begin talking to their children about alternative options, if their results are low or if they have failed.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
