An ad hoc committee is currently investigating the public broadcaster board's fitness to hold office. CAPE TOWN The parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board continued on Thursday.Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, who appeared before Members of Parliament (MPs) on Wednesday, defended the fact that she picked the people who carried out the disciplinary hearing that cleared Hlaudi Motsoeneng.WATCH: Parliamentary inquiry into SABC board.On Monday, the Western Cape High Court ruled that Motsoeneng may not occupy any post at the SABC until the Public Protector's 2014 report, which recommended he face a disciplinary inquiry, is reviewed and set aside.The court declared the initial disciplinary hearing that exonerated Motsoeneng to be wholly inadequate.Muthambi was confronted on the issue while testifying before Parliament's probe into the SABC board on Wednesday. African National Congress MP Juli Killian asked Muthambi about the people she selected for Motsoeneng s disciplinary hearing.&quot;The issue of me appointing the initiator, I ll urge the honourable member to go and read the court judgment, because there was no findings against me.&quot;But the judgment handed down this week clearly states that Muthambi s action was &quot;contrary to the law&quot;.Muthambi says she acted on a request from the board, when she put forward the names of two people to run the disciplinary process that cleared Motsoeneng.The judgment also reflects that Motsoeneng was among those who signed off on the board's decision to approve Muthambi s nominees.This, judge Owen Rogers found, was a clear conflict of interest.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
