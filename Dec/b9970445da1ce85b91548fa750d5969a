Some matrics arrived in Plett the annual event only to find the accommodation they&#8217;d booked was already occupied. CAPE TOWN - Plett Rage organisers suspect the man behind an accommodation scam may have swindled more holidaymakers.Police have yet to arrest the suspect.About 100 matriculants arrived in Plettenberg Bay last week for the annual event only to find the accommodation they thought they'd booked was already occupied.They'd been scammed out of thousands of rand.Plett Rage organiser Ronen Klugman says: We believe it extends into a season over the festive season, which is not specifically related to Plettenberg Bay. It s more related to the whole of December, so there are going to be a whole lot of sad people who will get to Plett Bay over the Christmas period who won t have accommodation.
