The SCA ruled a high court erred in granting Robin Stransham-Ford his request for assisted death clashed with the Constitution. CAPE TOWN - The Justice Alliance of South Africa (JASA) has welcomed the ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal in the right to die matter.On Tuesday the court ruled that the Gauteng High Court erred in its finding that granting Advocate Robin Stransham-Ford his request for assisted death clashed with the Constitution.The SCA also ruled that the issue involving doctor-assisted deaths should be debated by Parliament and not the courts as it s a moral and not legal issue.CEO of the JASA John Smyth says: We were very pleased with yesterday s ruling and particularly with the fact that the court recognised this is a moral issue; the question of the timing of one s death we believe it is a moral issue. Smyth adds they agree that the issue surrounding euthanasia should be kept out of the courts. The court recognises that and quite rightly said that it s a matter for Parliament if the law is going to be changed and not a matter for the judges of the courts. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
