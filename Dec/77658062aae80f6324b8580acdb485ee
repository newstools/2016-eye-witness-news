JOHANNESBURG Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on government to listen and heed the cry of South Africans rather than display arrogance. Ramaphosa says this is the only way a national consensus can be reached regarding issues facing the country. He addressed the third anniversary of Nelson Mandela s death in Houghton on Monday night.The deputy president says Madiba was a leader who understood the importance of dialogue as a helping mechanism in making decisions. Madiba often spoke about how, in his early antagonism towards the Communist Party, he had found that it was only through conversation where differences will reconcile. Ramphosa also spoke about the legacy of apartheid and how it continues to affect many people in the country. Ours was based on an ideology of racism and hatred. We may wish it away, we may want to deny that there s such a legacy but it is there. LISTEN: Former bodyguard shares fond memories of Madiba(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
