Weekend reports suggest that the Claasen Board of Inquiry has concluded and found that Phiyega is unfit to hold office. JOHANNESBURG - While the presidency says it's waiting for the final report into Riah Phiyega's fitness to hold office, questions have been raised about police morale and the public's confidence in the SAPS as the National Police Commissioner faces dismissal.Weekend reports suggest that the Claasen Board of Inquiry has concluded that Phiyega is unfit to hold office and has recommended that she be sacked.But president Jacob Zuma has not received the board's report and legal counsel for Phiyega say they will seek clarity on when the findings will be made available.The presidency says there's been a hold up in terms of the board of inquiry handing over its final report to President Zuma because there are a number of loose ends that need to be dealt with.The City Press however has reported that the board has already decided that Phiyega is unfit to hold office.The institute for security studies' Johann Burger says if this is true it could create some problems for the police going forward. This is extremely bad for police morale; it creates instability at leadership level. Phiyega's legal team says it will only comment on the findings once they've been handed over.(Edited by Neo Koza)
