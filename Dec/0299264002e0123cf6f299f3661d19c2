CAPE TOWN - Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa says she is working with the Saldanha Bay Municipality to ensure no one is denied access to West Coast beaches.Earlier this week, a furore erupted over an apparent move to restrict access to one of the beaches in the town.It's been reported that some Saldanha Bay residents were issued with permits allowing them access to the beachfront.People who don't have the cards are not allowed to use the nearby parking bays.In a statement, Molewa says the access to the country s natural resources, including the beach, is a constitutional right.It's only under certain strict circumstances that the public s access to the beach may be limited. Molewa says her department is working with the municipality and provincial government to determine whether it is warranted in barring access to one of the town s beaches.In an earlier interview with Eyewitness News, Mayor Marius Koen says the system had been introduced to curb late night partying and vandalism.Meanwhile, Molewa says her office will not hesitate to take any urgent enforcement measures to ensure all citizens have access to beaches.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
