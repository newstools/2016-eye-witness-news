Numsa says this is in honour of the 34 Marikana miners who were shot and killed by police in 2012. JOHANNESBURG The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has called for the proposed minimum wage to be increased to R12, 500 Numsa says this is in honour of the 34 Marikana miners who were shot and killed by police in 2012 during a wage dispute. Last month, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a R3,500 minimum wage proposed by a panel of advisors. The union has completed its 10th national congress which took place in Cape Town. Numsa s Patrick Craven says their members have expressed contempt for the proposed minimum wage. It was decided to go for R12,500, a demand which the Marikana workers died for. As a mark of respect for them we believe that s a reasonable salary. This week, Numsa President Andrew Chirwa said they need stronger commitment from government to address economic challenges facing the country.Chirwa also expressed his view on the proposed National Minimum Wage. It represents an insult to the working class, who are the majority in this country and are still at the bottom of this economy. We reject what [Deputy President] Cyril Ramaphosa has said that workers can survive with R3,500, when we know that R3,500 represents pocket money for his children. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
