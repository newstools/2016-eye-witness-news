We have large numbers of extra enforcement staff on beaches, at public pools and all over the city. We also have significant additional staff and volunteers out from disaster management, the emergency call centre and various other departments have emergency staff on standby. Smith says the municipality s identi-kids programme, aimed at ensuring children don t go missing at beaches, has also been implemented. Disaster management has been running the identi-kids programme; at various beaches we are issuing armbands to children arriving at the beach, so that if they are separated from their parents we are able to reunite them with minimum trauma.
