Stats SA released November's CPI figure of 6.6%, which is a 0.3% increase since October. CAPE TOWN - Inflation has rallied to its highest levels in nine months.Stats SA released November's Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) figure of 6.6% on Wednesday morning, which is a 0.3% increase since October.The number is outside the South African Reserve Bank s target band of 3% and 6%, but the rise was anticipated in its last monetary policy review.Market analyst Jana van Deventer says the price of transport has increased by 1.5% month-on-month. The main driver of high CPI into the fourth quarter has been an increase in transport inflation. And this is to a large degree the results of a low base effect in the oil market, that s now stimulating fuel price inflation into the final months of the year. She adds that the effects of the drought also played a role. Food inflation is still quite sticky but encouragingly it did peel back slightly in November. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
