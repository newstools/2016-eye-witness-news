SHARK ACTIVITYCape Town beachgoers are being urged to be cautious in the water due to shark activity.Heavy sea swells prevented the deployment of the shark net at Fish Hoek along the False Bay coastline on Monday. But it s back in action on Tuesday to create a protection barrier for bathers.Cape Town s beaches are packed with sunbathers. Two shark spotters are currently deployed on each of the eight city beaches mostly along the False Bay coast, where shark activity is common.Shark Spotters research manager Dr Alison Kock said, This time of the year in Cape Town is when the white sharks use the beaches a lot. They are looking for fish, other sharks and they are also enjoying the warmer waters and it is not unusual at all. Holidaymakers who are concerned about great whites in the water can download a free cellphone app for more details on shark activity. The app also provides details on water temperature, whale and seal sightings.
