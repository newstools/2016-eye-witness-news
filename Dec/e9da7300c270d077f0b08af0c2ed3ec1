The former Proteas batsman on Wednesday admitted to several breaches of South Africa&#8217;s anti-corruption code. JOHANNESBURG An apologetic Alviro Petersen has told Eyewitness News he hopes his two-year ban from cricket will help educate players in future to better cope with the pressures of corruption in cricket.The former Proteas batsman on Monday admitted to several breaches of South Africa s anti-corruption code and was been banned from all forms of the game for two years.The sanction follows a lengthy investigation which led to a 20-year ban on Gulam Bodi who acted as an intermediary for international betting syndicates.Petersen says players need to be educated more about graft. I don t think any of the players knew how to deal with that sort of stuff and whether it s the failure of the players part, personally I wasn t too aware on how to deal with it. I always knew that I had to report the matter. I ve taken responsibility for it and if good can come from it, then that s important for me because I don t want any other player in future to get caught up in this mess. Cricket South Africa (CSA) has withdrawn certain charges against Petersen, including those relating to fixing or contriving to fix any match and seeking, accepting or offering to accept any bribe or other reward to fix or influence any match.Commenting on the ban, CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: Alviro has realised his mistakes and has acknowledged contravening the code. He is obliged under the code to have disclosed various approaches that were made to him to engage in corrupt activities.&quot;(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
