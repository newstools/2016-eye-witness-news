Mbulaheni Maguvhe went to the Western Cape High Court to interdict the ad hoc committee from beginning with its probe. CAPE TOWN The last remaining South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board member Mbulaheni Maguvhe has filed for leave to appeal a high court ruling which dismissed his previous application to halt the parliamentary committee tasked with investigating the public broadcaster s board. The Parliamentary ad hoc committee is now to decide whether proceedings will be suspended pending the outcome of this court action. Last week, Maguvhe went to the Western Cape High Court to interdict the committee from beginning with the probe. But his application was unsuccessful. The inquiry was to get underway this morning. Committee chairperson Vincent Smith has explained to fellow Members of Parliament the latest developments. Senior Council advised that although there s no court order prohibiting this inquiry to proceed, he also however advises that the committee should consider putting the proceedings on hold while we explore the appeal.
