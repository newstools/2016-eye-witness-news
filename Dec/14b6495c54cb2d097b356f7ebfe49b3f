CAPE TOWN The Cape Town Sevens rugby tournament has proved to be a hit with both local and out-of-town visitors.Over 100,000 fans attended the two day tournament at Cape Town stadium over the weekend.Last week, it was announced that the event will be extended by a further three years and will remain in Cape Town until at least 2019.The City of Cape Town will spend about R13 million on services to the tournament over the next three years, while the metro expects to make just over R9 million in revenue.Some fans say Cape Town can become the Rugby Sevens capital of the world. I think Cape Town Stadium is the best venue to host the Rugby Sevens. It s cheaper coming here than going all the way to Hong Kong because it s really well organised. It s brilliant. Cape Town Tourism officials say the event is also a major boost to the tourism economy.ENGLAND BREAKS SA S HEARTSEngland Broke South African Hearts as they caused a major upset by beating the much favoured Blitzboks 19-17 in the Mother City.Blitzboks were denied their fourth successive Cape Town Sevens title in South Africa and could not build on last week s success in Dubai.The home team scored first courtesy of Chris Dry who showed a clean pair of heels which sent the crowd into raptures.However, the English came back strong scoring two tries in quick succession to lead 12-5 at the break.The Blitzboks struck back early in the second half courtesy of a chip and chase by Rosco Specman to level matters at 12 apiece.England retook the lead after piling on the pressure to take the lead 19-12, displaying their superb attitude which has been a feature of their Day 2 performance.In a dramatic twist, England received a yellow card, the home team soon made their numerical advantage count as they scored in the last move of the game; Werner Kok was the try scorer.Unfortunately, it was not to be for the Blitzboks as Justin Geduld failed to convert a tough conversion from the corner.England took the honours 19-17 as they remain a tricky side for the impressive but ultimately disappointed Blitzboks.
