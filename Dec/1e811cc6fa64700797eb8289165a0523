Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe delivered a State of the Nation Address with no reference to bond notes or his retirement plans. HARARE - President Robert Mugabe has delivered a state of the nation address with no reference to bond notes or his retirement plans.Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai had urged Mugabe to use the speech to announce plans to step down.This was a sometimes-hesitant delivery by President Mugabe, but the content of his speech was resolutely upbeat.The Zimbabwe president mentioned things like improved power supply and an increase in tourist arrivals.But the speech did not mention the thing that occupies many Zimbabweans minds these days: when can I get my money from the bank?Mugabe steered clear of any mention of the new bond notes released by his government last week, which many fear will bring shortages and hyperinflation. Instead, Mugabe commended Zimbabweans for remaining resilient through economic hardships in the past, and he praised the defence forces for maintaining a peaceful environment.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
