The JHB mayor on Thursday commemorated just over three months in office &amp; delivered his progress report. JOHANNESBURG Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba s first 100 days in office was greeted with mixed reaction from opposition parties. Mashaba commemorated just over three months in office on Thursday and delivered his progress report in Johannesburg.The mayor says his administration has hit the ground running and has now completed the housing list which he says has 79,000 people on it, dating back to 1996. Mashaba lamented on the achievements of his administration so far and thanked the coalition parties and king makers the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for their work on the ground and in council. While the EFF s Mosa Novela says he believes Mashaba s speech was mere lip service, he says the Democratic Alliance (DA) has heeded his party s calls on a number of issues, such as scrapping the bicycle lanes project. It was the EFF that said that all projects of bicycle lanes should be stopped until we ensure that people have got houses, they ve got electricity and water supply. At the same time, the African National Congress (ANC)'s Jolidee Motonga says there was nothing ground-breaking about Mashaba s plans.Motonga says it s a tragedy that Mashaba canceled what he calls vanity projects, which include the bicycle lanes.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
