The UN experts have called on the country to set up a policy framework to guide the relocation process. JOHANNESBURG As the world marks International Day for Persons with Disabilities, four UN experts have called on South African authorities to establish a clear plan of action following the deaths of 37 psychiatric patients in Gauteng.The patients had been transferred from the Life Esidimeni Private Centre to various NGOs across the province after the Gauteng Health Department cancelled its contract with the facility.Various organisations have called for Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu to step down, accusing her of negligence for transferring the patients to inadequately equipped facilities.The UN experts have called on the country to set up a policy framework to guide the relocation process, with the appropriate consultation and support to all persons concerned.They say the transfer of people with disabilities to unsuitable locations without their consent and adequate support may result in further grave abuses of their right to physical and mental integrity.The experts agree that while deinstitutionalization is the right approach there must be clear plans of action with timelines and benchmarks when moving patients to other facilitiesMeanwhile, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi instituted an investigation by the health ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba, who has confirmed that the probe is underway.MORE CLAIMS OF CARELESSNESSLast month, the Gauteng Health Department said it was happy with the manner in which patients are being treated at different locations.The DA Shadow MEC for Health Jack Bloom said a report by the Tshwane Health and Social Development Department has found that the Rebafenyi Mental Health Institution in Pretoria is not zoned to accommodate mental health patients, amongst other things.Bloom said the Tshwane Health and Social Development Department found that the institution has no health certificate from the municipal environmental health practitioners. I think this is very serious. It shows yet again that there was a rush to form an NGO for psychiatric patients. But Gauteng Health spokesperson Steve Mabona said officials are already busy with this document. There s confirmation that the centre is working with health environment practitioners. Mabona said he can no longer stress on the fact that their officials visited all the NGOs and gave them the green light to house psychiatric patients. We ve said, I mean there were teams that were on the ground doing this work, making sure that they check that these places are ready. Bloom said one of the 37 patients who died after being transferred from Esidimeni was housed at the institution in question.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
