Thrice he offered to take a lie-detector test so that we could prove that there was nothing corrupt about what he was doing, that he was just doing his job.

The one that reached my desk, I realised there was no fulfillment of contractual obligations but the payments were effected, which was a serious concern for me. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
