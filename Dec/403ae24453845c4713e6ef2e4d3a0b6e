The SACP&#8217;s Alex Mashilo says the decline in the ANC is as a result of internal war taking place for succession. JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party (SACP) is calling for the African National Congress (ANC) to come with protocol and clear policy on the leadership succession.The party says disruptions and destructions after each and every elective conference of the ANC are damaging the party and its other alliance components.The SACP s Alex Mashilo says the decline in the ruling party s support in the August local elections, was as a result of internal war taking place for succession in every level of the party. The ANC needs to look at protocols and procedures for revolutionary discipline and institutional approach towards leadership transition within the party, because the disruptions not only affect the ANC, they also affect the wider political support of the party. Meanwhile, the SACP said it is concerned that state security agencies are being used in to the ANC infighting.The SACP said the security cluster should be concerned about South Africans instead of pursuing the political battles by members of the ANC.The communist party also says the charges against Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride, former Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya, private investigator Paul O Sullivan and crime intelligence officer Candice Coetzee is a clear evidence that state organs are being used to propagate narrow political end.Mashilo said, We must analyse the whole organisation of state organs afresh; and collectively identify the root of the political hand that manipulates these organs of state to fight inner party battles, to settle political scores and to target people who are critical of certain authorities. He also said the process in charging the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, which were later dropped was handled incompetently. Certainly something has to be done. The fact that this manipulation is clearly visible means that the cheques and balances that are in place are not efficient to prevent manipulation. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
