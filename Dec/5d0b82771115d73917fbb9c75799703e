Solicitors who draw up wills says it&#8217;s increasingly common for social media users to want their profiles updated after death. LONDON Speaking from beyond the grave is something becoming increasingly popular among British social media users. Solicitors who draw up wills says it s increasingly common for social media users to want their profiles and messages updated after death. In a survey more than half of Facebook users are said to want their pages updated after they have died.Having the last word isn t always so easy. In a survey of 2,000 UK Facebook users 52% said they d like their pages maintained after their death with a third nominating someone to have access to their account. Many see the social media afterlife as a great way of replying to expressions of sympathy for them. Fifty-five percent wanted memories shared a couple of times a year, and 10% asked for someone to post once a week to keep their memory alive.Solicitors drawing up wills suggest people nominate a social media manager and keep passwords in a sealed envelope. It seems a Briton s dying words aren t always their last.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
