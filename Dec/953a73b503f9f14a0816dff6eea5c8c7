As of next year the University of Pretoria will begin phasing out Afrikaans as a language of instruction. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court has dismissed AfriForum s application to reverse a new language policy at the University of Pretoria that will see Afrikaans being phased out in lectures.The lobby group, together with trade union Solidarity, took the university to court earlier this month arguing that English should not be the primary medium of instruction at Tuks.Today the court ruled against their bid.AfriForum's Alana Bailey says the group is disappointed with the judgement. We feel that this judgement is a blow to language rights in general in South Africa and that is why we would like to appeal if we have grounds for that in the judgement. As of next year the university will begin phasing out Afrikaans as a language of tuition.(Edited by Neo Koza)
