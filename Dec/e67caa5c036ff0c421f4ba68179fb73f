Music, fashion and passion seemed to be the highlight of this year&#8217;s elections. JOHANNESBURG - While the 2016 municipal elections has gone down as one of the most fiercely contested since the birth of democracy, this year's poll was more than just a political affair.Parties made use of interesting items of clothing and what some may term as smug slogans. Entertainment was also in abundance during this year's contest.The African National Congress (ANC)'s green and yellow doek became a trade mark in this year's race, coupled with the slogan Asinavalo , meaning 'we have no fear'.The party went as far as selling some unusual items like gloves and deodorant , which became surprisingly popular.ANC merchandise store owner Kutlo Marumo says although sales did peak during the election, the store hit a historical low in sales when the Democratic Alliance (DA) assumed power in Johannesburg.WATCH: 'Dabs' &amp; Jabs: ANC ready to rule #Elections2016While the DA stuck to their blue T-shirts and caps for regalia, the party did not hold back on their advertising.
