Lesotho nationals studying, working and living in SA have until midnight on Saturday to apply for special permits. JOHANNESBURG The Home Affairs Department says Lesotho nationals have until midnight on Saturday to apply for special permits. The department says the permit is issued under the special dispensation for Lesotho nationals who are working, studying or running businesses in South Africa, and have been in the country in such capacity before the 30 September 2015.The deadline has already been postponed twice, in June and September.Home Affairs Director General Mkuseli Apleni says although there are officially about half a million of Basotho living and working in South Africa, they have only received 120, 000 applications so far.Apleni says those who don t comply will face strong action. Come the end of this project, and you did not take the opportunity that is your own problem. We will deport anyone who is in our country as an illegal, and we will also declare you as undesirable which means you cannot return to South Africa until after five years.
