CAPE TOWN University of Cape Town council chairperson Sipho Pityana has slammed government for failing South African students.Speaking at Tuesday s graduation ceremony Pityana said the doors to higher education institutions were still closed to many.The institution has been one of the worst affected by student-led protests calling for government to scrap fees.He also warned that implementing fee-free tertiary education for all may result in the system regressing further. There can be no doubt that education as a whole is an area of government failure. As we talk about better conditions for students at universities we need to worry about the inequality for many to access higher education. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
