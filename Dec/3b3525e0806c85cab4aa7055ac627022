The parliamentary committee earlier on Monday heard that all the power at the SABC resided with Hlaudi Motsoeneng. CAPE TOWN - The SABC inquiry has heard that relations between former SABC chief executive Lulama Mokhobo and Hlaudi Motsoeneng were so poor that at times she was reduced to tears.Sipho Masinga the former head of technology at the public broadcaster is currently giving testimony in Parliament.Earlier on Monday, the inquiry heard that all the power at the SABC resided on the 27th floor of Auckland Park, where Motsoeneng's office was located.Masinga says Mokhobo tried to tolerate Motsoeneng s interference but that relations between them were terrible . I warned that if you are dealing with a taker they don t stop. They keep taking. You can give an arm [but] they want all of you. I would come to her office and I would feel sorry for [her] and see that she is crying. He has also described how he blocked a bid by the Gupta-owned TNA media to take over SABC News and rebrand it.Masinga also says Motsoeneng lobbied him to ditch the government s then policy that set-top boxes be encrypted and tried to engineer things so that Masinga would report to him and not to the CEO.At the same time, SABC journalists are testifying about what they ve described as a reign of terror waged by Motsoeneng and his cohorts at Auckland Park.The journalists are among the so-called SABC 8 who challenged editorial policy changes and interference at the public broadcaster.Economics editor Thandeka Gqubule says the principles and ethics of journalism have been subverted. At the SABC we have borne witness of the painful death of public service journalism. Journalism is central to a democracy. Public service journalism is dying at the SABC and every day we as journalists and editors bear witness to a mandate betrayed. (Edited by Neo Koza)
