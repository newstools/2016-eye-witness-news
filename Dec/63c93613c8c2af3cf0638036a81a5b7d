The ad hoc committee last week made the decision to hold off on calling MultiChoice as a witness, for now. CAPE TOWN The Parliamentary ad hoc committee looking into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board is yet to decide whether to call on MultiChoice to testify.The committee is waiting for certain documents from the board, including those pertaining to the agreement between the SABC and MultiChoice in 2013.Last week, the public broadcasters' former CEO Lulama Mokhobo, who stepped down after serving just two years of her five-year term, told Members of Parliament she was not involved in the controversial deal , which she said affected the digital migration process.The ad hoc committee last week made the decision to hold off on calling MultiChoice as a witness, for now.Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said it was waiting for documents from the board about the agreement between MultiChoice and the SABC. We allow that process to reach its conclusion and exhaust that avenue, because I believe to do anything differently would be premature. Smith added if the committee failed to get the information from the SABC, it would consider calling MultiChoice to testify.Mokhobo last week told the committee she wasn t involved in signing the agreement between the broadcaster and MultiChoice, which included a clause that the set-top boxes necessary for the digital migration of television be non-encrypted. This apparently was to the advantage of the SABC and MultiChoice. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
