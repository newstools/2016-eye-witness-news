The MK veteran Joel Netshitenze says if opportunists are given the platform, they will take advantage. JOHANNESBURG Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) veteran Joel Netshitenze says the continued political interference at state institutions shows that those who are beneficiaries of state capture, and corruption will not give up without a fight.Netshitenze was speaking at the MK national council which is currently underway at Nasrec, south of Johannesburg.He says the municipal election results have proven that if the African National Congress (ANC) does not resolve its internal issues it faces the possibility of further punishment at the national polls in 2019.The MK veteran says if opportunists are given the platform, they will take advantage. From the strange things that are happening; from the South African Revenue Service involving the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority, Denel and so on, a cabinet statement by a cabinet minister that never was; all these terrors show you that the beneficiaries of corruption and state capture will not give up without a fight. At the same time, fellow veteran Siphiwe Nyanda says the beneficiaries of state capture are likely to try and subvert their efforts. We may well be ignored. Our efforts may well be frustrated by those who have an interest in preserving the status quo. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
