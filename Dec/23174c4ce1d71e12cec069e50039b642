Nzimande says while the ANC has done a lot for the country, the political dynamics post the local government election results, have shifted. JOHANNESBURG South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande says the African National Congress (ANC) and other political organisations can no longer mobilise people based on the past but says a focus on the youths needs is more important right now. Nzimande was speaking at the Young Communist League s third national council which is underway in Soweto this weekend.He questioned the relevance of the tripartite alliance relationship in this era.The SACP leader says while the ANC has done a lot for the country, the political dynamics post the local government election results, have shifted. Before the election, the ANC used to control about 85% of municipal budgets but now it controls 30% if not less. It s a huge drop. He says there should be a more focused look at young people s needs. We have to mobilise on the basis of what people want now because many of them don t care who was an MK or who was in prison. Nzimande adds that he however feels the fees must fall movement is ideologically flawed.
