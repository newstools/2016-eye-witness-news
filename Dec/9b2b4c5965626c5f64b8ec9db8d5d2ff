The party says it laid fraud charges against the former SABC board chair Ellen Tshabalala but nothing has happened. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of the People (Cope) says it strongly suspects that police may be involved in South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) corrupt network because it is difficult for authorities to conclude on straight forward cases that involve the public broadcaster. The party says it has laid fraud charges against the former SABC board chair Ellen Tshabalala for misrepresenting her education qualifications on July 2015 but nothing has happened with this case to date.It has also laid corruption and fraud charges against head of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng for selling the archives of the public broadcaster to MultiChoice, They say this case was opened two months ago and Motsoeneng has still not been brought to book.Cope s Dennis Bloem says the SABC saga is much bigger and deeper than meets the eye. We don t have any hesitation to say there is a lot of evidence that exists and we don t know why the police find it difficult to take them to court so that a magistrate or a judge may decide.
