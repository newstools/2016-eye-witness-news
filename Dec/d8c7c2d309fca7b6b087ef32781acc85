The organisation says that NPA and the Hawks will remain compromised for as long those who appoint the leaders fear their independence. JOHANNESBURG - Corruption Watch is warning that the National Prosecuting Authority and the Hawks will remain the most compromised institutions for as long as those who appoint its leaders question their integrity. The organisation issued the warning during Friday s commemoration of International Anti-Corruption Day at Unisa in Pretoria. The event also marks the launch for public participation of the anti-graft strategy. Corruption Watch s David Lewis has welcomed the anti-corruption strategy, but says its effectiveness will be limited for as long as there is instability in the criminal justice system. As long as those who are responsible for appointing the leadership of the police and the prosecutorial authorities have reasons to fear the actions of truly independent law enforcement institutions, then you can bet your bottom dollar that these would be the most compromised institutions in the land. Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says government remains committed to tackling corruption. Corruption in both public and private sectors has got a detrimental effect on our own country s development and our government s effort to effectively deliver services to all its people. Public participation events to discuss the strategy will start early next year.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
