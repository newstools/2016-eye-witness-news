CAPE TOWN - The National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) has slammed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for not speeding up job creation in the country.Gordhan and Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel addressed delegates during the trade union federation's 10th national congress at the Cape Town International Convention Centre this past week.Numsa President Andrew Chirwa says they need stronger commitment from government to address economic challenges facing the country.Chirwa also expressed his view on the proposed National Minimum Wage. It represents an insult to the working class, who are the majority in this country and are still at the bottom of this economy. We reject what [Deputy President] Cyril Ramaphosa has said that workers can survive with R3,500, when we know that R3,500 represents pocket money for his children. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
