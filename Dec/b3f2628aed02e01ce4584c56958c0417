What we have seen is almost a quadrupling of illegal fishing and poaching of rock lobster, because it s such an inshore and easily accessible resource. A lot of rock lobster is caught by small scale fishermen, so their livelihoods are also in trouble if the specie disappears. You know it as kreef, but soon you may not know it at all. The West Coast rock lobster is now endangered. #SkipTheKreef this summer! pic.twitter.com/zw7hkWC0yy(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
