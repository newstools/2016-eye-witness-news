CAPE TOWN - The High Court in the Western Cape has ruled that South African Broadcasting Cooperation (SABC) group executive of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng may not hold any position at the corporation.The court has ruled that Motsoeneng s appointment was both unlawful and unconstitutional.The Western Cape High Court has found the SABC board failed to uphold the Constitution and ignored findings in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report When Governance and Ethics Fail. The report found Hlaudi Motsoeneng had lied about his qualifications and awarded himself irregular salary hikes. The court ruled that Motsoeneng is suspended pending the outcome of new disciplinary proceedings into his fitness to hold office and a judicial review of the Public Protector s report.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said: We are of the complete view that it is a victory today. Motsoeneng cannot work at the SABC and I m also glad that he personally pays for the cost for this case and stop litigating on the basis of the tax payer s money. The court has ruled the SABC is liable for the applicant's legal costs.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
