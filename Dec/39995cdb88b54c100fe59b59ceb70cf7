The president's son has continued to have a relationship with the Gupta family, flying to &amp; from Dubai on their private jet. JOHANNESBURG - Eyewitness News has learnt that the president's son Duduzane Zuma has used the Guptas private plane to enter and leave South Africa several times after he supposedly resigned from Oakbay Investments.Zuma arrived at Lanseria Airport on the private jet on 7 December, from Dubai.In April this year, Zuma, along with two Gupta brothers, made a public announcement about resigning from Oakbay Investments, citing concerns for the company's future due to the political aspersions cast on their involvement.Zuma also stood out as a central figure in the Public Protector's State of Capture report as a facilitator for the Guptas and one of the people who took Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas to a meeting, where he was offered Nhlanhla Nene's job as finance minister.WATCH: Jonas: The Guptas offered me finance minister jobFlight records in EWN s possession show that Zuma continued to use the private plane five times to enter and leave the country following his resignation, sometimes along with businessman Salim Essa, who is a known associate of the Guptas.Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says this development confirms suspicions that there was no intention to cut ties. There was no meaningful intention on the side of Zuma to disentangle himself from the Gupta business. The Guptas seem to have strategically no longer wanted their businesses to be seen in South Africa and attempts to incorporate these business interests outside South Africa. Repeated attempts to get comment from Zuma, the Guptas and Oakbay were unsuccessful.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
