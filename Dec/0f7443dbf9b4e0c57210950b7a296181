JOHANNESBURG - Motorists can breathe a sigh of relief as the price of petrol is expected to go down by 20 cents a litre at midnight. The price of diesel will also decrease by 32 cents a litre, while illuminating paraffin will cost 28 cents less per litre. The drop in fuel prices comes as a result of a strengthening rand and a drop in international oil prices. The Automobile Association s Layton Beard says: Recent developments surrounding OPEC obviously are going to curb the rally that the international petroleum price has. Oil prices are expected to increase and that will have an impact going forward on the price of petrol, specifically towards the end of December going into January. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
