Thuli Madonsela said that students who are academically deserving should be able to have access to tertiary education. JOHANNESBURG Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela says she will be working with Operation South Africa in assisting the #FeesMustFall student movement to find solutions.Madonsela was speaking on the sidelines of the Save Syria briefing in Johannesburg yesterday where she highlighted her support for the campaign's aims to assists victims of war-torn Syria. Madonsela said students who are academically deserving should be able to have access to tertiary education. Every promise in the Constitution means that if you can t afford that for yourself, government will make sure that it is provided to you. She says she remains an advocate for free education and government needs to ensure that those needs are met. So free education is a human right to those who can t afford to pay for themselves. The Save Syria initiative says it's preparing to put in place a distribution plan to ensure those suffering in Syria receive aid as soon as possible. Madonsela has lent her support to the cause and says the initiative is about understanding that we are all part of one human race. When one part of humanity hurts, the rest of us will eventually hurt. It s really part of ubuntu. Madonsela has also responded to the criticism that Operation South Africa should be just as invested in dealing with South Africa s problems as those in Syria. Already they re making sure that Operation SA is responsive to any need. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
