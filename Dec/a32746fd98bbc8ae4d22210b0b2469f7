The constables will spend one year on probation and will be based at police stations across the country. PRETORIA Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane says the graduation of new recruits under his Back to Basics programme comes at the time when additional resources are needed to protect malls and ensure the public is safe over the festive season. Phahlane and Police Minister Nathi Nhleko presided over a graduation ceremony in Pretoria West today one of several happening around the country. About 5,000 recruits will be deployed to police stations as constables to complete their police training. Phahlane says the recruits have already started their operations training. Our new recruits have over the past few weeks been deployed in the malls and shopping centres here in Gauteng. They have already experienced the reality of policing. Nhleko told the recruits that their police careers have officially started. You can make an immediate and visible contribution to policing on a daily basis starting of course with this festive season. The security of our people and their property is now in your hands. The constables will spend one year on probation and will be based at police stations across the country.WATCH: New SAPS graduates are ready for anything(Edited by Neo Koza)
