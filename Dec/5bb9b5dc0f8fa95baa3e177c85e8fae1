UWC Professor Emerita Shirley Walters says the campaign should be an ongoing one, rather than just over a limited period. CAPE TOWN - A University of Western Cape (UWC) professor and founder of the Women s Hope Education and Training Trust Emerita Shirley Walters says believes the 16 Days of Activism Campaign for No Violence Against Women and Children is ineffective.The campaign, which is an international awareness raising initiative aimed at turning the spotlight on the scourge of violence against women and children, concludes this weekend.Professor Walters says the 16 Days of Activism campaign is not enough. One its own, it s like a fireworks display that you see in all of its glory and then it s really a damp squibso we need to think about it strategically and in different ways. Walters believes the campaign needs to be part of a year-long set of programmes and processes that deals with the problem.She adds the campaign should be an ongoing one, rather than just over a limited period.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
