MMC Nonhlanhla Sifumba says says the toxic fumes came from a chemical that had been used to unblock a drain near the lake. JOHANNESBURG - Community Development MMC Nonhlanhla Sifumba says the number of children who inhaled toxic fumes of pool acid at Zoo Lake in Johannesburg is 20 and not 33 as it had been reported.Sifumba says the children were rushed to hospital but have since been discharged.She says the toxic fumes came from a chemical that had been used to unblock a drain near the lake.The poisonous emissions spread inside toward the stream after strong winds blew in the children s direction.Sifumba says the City of Johannesburg sympathises with those affected and have arranged flowers for them. This did not happen because of the negligence of the officials of the swimming pool; it is what you may call an act of nature because it is the wind that blew the fumes towards where people were. Unfortunately, they were inside the pool so it s not negligence on the side of officials that work at the pool.
