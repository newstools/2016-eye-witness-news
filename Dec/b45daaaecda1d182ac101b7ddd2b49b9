The Bungalow, which found itself in a social media race storm, says it will review its billing system. CAPE TOWN - A Clifton restaurant which found itself in a social media race storm says it will review its billing system.Speaking at a briefing following a meeting with the the African National Congress Youth League in the Cape Town region on Friday, The Bungalow restaurant's owners insist it's not their policy to identify patrons by their race.This after one of the eatery's waiters apparently identified two patrons as &quot;2 blacks&quot; on their bill. Mike Dzange was suspended following the incident, but returned to work yesterday.The restaurant's proprietor, Paul Kovensky, says their policy is to identify customers by table numbers.&quot;It was brought to our attention that in order for waiters to keep track of customers and to make it easy for them, they use their own shorthand. Unfortunately, it was only been brought to our attention in this incident and the kind of tagging done before was very simple, using a hat, shoe or shirt.&quot;Kovensky adds they are doing away with the system.&quot;We've spoken to our point of sale company and will be shutting down facilities, so they'll no longer be able to fill in that information on the till slip.&quot;The youth league's Unathi Tshotwana welcomed the decision.&quot;People must not be identified by their race, whether it's two whites or two Muslims, if they're sitting at table one, two or three. You should be identified by the table you're sitting at, not your race or clothing. This is the resolution.&quot;(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
