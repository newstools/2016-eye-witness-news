SABC technology head Sipho Masinga told stunned MPs that TNA Media presented its plan to take over SABC News in a document of just three pages. CAPE TOWN - Parliament s inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board s fitness to hold office has been told of an extraordinary attempt by a Gupta-owned company to take over SABC News.Former head of technology Sipho Masinga testified before the inquiry.He said he was called by then chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng to a surprise meeting with TNA Media s Nazeem Howa.TNA Media owns the news broadcaster ANN7 and the New Age newspaper.Masinga told stunned MPs that TNA Media presented its plan to take over SABC News in a document of just three pages. I look at it, it s talking about re-branding the SABC News, that the SABC would provide resources, TNA would not pay any rental, SABC would provide journalists, TNA would retain advertising revenue. This would have meant the outsourcing of the public broadcaster s news offering to the Gupta company, essentially for free. Now we are talking about the takeover of a function of the national broadcaster. Just that itself was enough for me to send him back. But you know, but we re nice and find a cunning way to say ja , just go and make it more appealing so we sent it back. Masinga says Motsoeneng had earlier left the meeting, which took place before TNA Media launched its own news channel, ANN7.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
