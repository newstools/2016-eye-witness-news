The producers lost an urgent court application to interdict the SABC from cancelling the show before its contract expires. JOHANNESBURG The producers of the popular daily series on SABC 3, High Rollers, says they will be taking the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), after they lost an urgent court application to interdict the broadcaster from cancelling the show before its contract expires.Producers say a 30 day cancellation is unprecedented and by making such a move the SABC has set an example that may be dangerous in the future. They are also unsure of when the show will be taken off air. Producer Meren Reddy says they have had to let go of the entire show s team leaving cast and crew without employment. Reddy says they hope there will be some developments with the application with Icasa. The reason for this interdict was to stop them from cancelling High Rollers in that we could continue working. One of the leading actors in the drama series Justin Strydom says the cancellation will hit the actors hardest as it leaves them without income for the coming months. You go from earning X-amount, to earning absolutely nothing. The notice period is so short that you don t have time to react. Meanwhile, the public broadcaster says contractual issues between the production company and the broadcaster cannot be discussed in the public space.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
