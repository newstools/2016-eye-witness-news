Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini says they can't be neutral as the party&#8217;s actions continue to affect the workers. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Sdumo Dlamini says the African National Congress (ANC) cannot expect Cosatu to remain neutral when it comes to the party s succession debate because the party s actions affect workers.Dlamini was speaking earlier on Thursday at the Young Communist League s 3rd national council in Soweto.The federation recently endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over from President Jacob Zuma at the party s elective conference in 2017.Cosatu says it cannot be a neutral player when it comes to the ANC s succession debate, with Dlamini saying not when the party s actions continue to affect the workers. As long as the ANC remains the ruling party, whose actions on good or bad have a direct impact on us as workers, we do not take a neutral position on that situation. The ANC criticised the federation for pronouncing on which leader they prefer as the next president, accusing it of meddling in the party s internal issues.But the federation says the country is desperate for a leader who will quote wake up and lead the organisation .At the same time, the Cosatu president has lashed out over the state of the ANC lead alliance, saying it needs to be reconfigured.The SACP has previously criticised the ANC and Zuma in public for his involvement in the state capture report and the party s failure to investigate allegations that the Gupta family has influenced the state. The ANC has also recently admitted that the state of the alliance is weak.Dlamini says the alliance needs to sort itself out. In our view, the alliance in its current form is unable to respond as effectively as it ought to be toward the challenges we are confronted with today. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
