Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini says the trade union federation is concerned about the state of the ANC &amp; wants the party to get its house in order. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Sdumo Dlamini says the federation is concerned about the state of the African National Congress (ANC) and has called on the party to get its house in order. Dlamini was speaking earlier on Friday at the Young Communist League s third national council in Soweto under the theme Intensifying Youth Mobilisation for Socialism . The federation recently endorsed deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to take over from President Jacob Zuma at the party's elective conference next year. Dlamini says at the federation's last central executive committee, members spent about four to five hours discussing the state of the ANC and according to their assembly it s not impressive. The ANC at the political level would ve been viewed by the CEC as if it was an organisation that was comfortable to be seen as if it is at war with itself. He says ANC leaders must stop fighting each other. Why on earth would we enjoy seeing leaders fighting each other in public? He says the federation will approach leaders of the ANC to discuss these concerns.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
