CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has ruled the City of Cape Town needs to give a final answer about the Tweede Nuwejaar parade by 28 December.Several minstrel associations are vying for the chance to host the annual parade which usually takes place on 2 January.The city has been at loggerheads with different associations over the past few weeks. The latest spat with the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association (CTMCA) saw the association's Voorsmaakie parade being cancelled due to non-compliance.The CTMCA is also upset because the municipality has allocated R4 million to the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Assosiasie.The City's Eddie Andrews says: The judge ruled that the city has to issue a permit by no later than 28 December and that the city has been very accommodating in this process. We will be issuing the permit by 28 December provided the applicant is fully compliant. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
