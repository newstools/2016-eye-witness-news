The DA has approached the High Court in Pretoria challenging the constitutionality of Cabinet&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the ICC. JOHANNESBURFG The Democratic Alliance (DA) has argued that the manner in which government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) has fundamentally breached the rights of Parliament.The party has approached the High Court in Pretoria where it s challenging the constitutionality of Cabinet s decision. Justice Minister Michael Masutha announced the move last month, saying the United Nations had already been informed of South Africa s withdrawal from the Rome statute. The high court last year ruled that government was obliged to arrest Sudanese President Omar al Bashir who is wanted on crimes including genocide when he attended the African Union summit in Johannesburg. The DA s advocate Stephen Budlender says the decision to withdraw from the ICC should have first been discussed in Parliament.He says the power to withdraw from international treaties is conferred on Parliament, not the executive. My client s interest as the official opposition is to ensure that this matter is properly debated in Parliament and that it becomes a proper public debate. It says that the rights of Parliament have been fundamentally breached by what s been going on. The council for the advancement of the South African Constitution has further argued that treaties are only binding - after the adoption of a resolution by the National Assembly.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
