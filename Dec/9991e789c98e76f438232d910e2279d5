SABC&#8217;s former acting CEO Phil Molefe says Hlaudi Motsoeneng proposed that the Gupta family be part of the broadcaster's news channel. CAPE TOWN - The parliamentary inquiry investigating the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board has heard how Hlaudi Motsoeneng allegedly tried to influence a deal for the Guptas to own a part of SABC s 24-hour news channel.This emerged when the public broadcaster s former acting CEO Phil Molefe made submissions to the ad hoc committee on Friday.Molefe spoke of an erosion of internal systems, governance and ethics which he says dates back to 2011.He told Members of Parliament (MPs) that in 2011 Motsoeneng approached him with a proposal in which the Gupta family would own a share of the 24-hour news channel.Molefe claims several meetings were held with Tony Gupta to discuss this and the distribution of the New Age newspaper to all SABC offices. He says he turned down the proposals. In the end, the position I took did not go down well with the Gupta brothers. Motsoeneng tried to persuade me and urged me to soften my approach in dealing with the Gupta. Molefe told the ad hoc committee the proposals from the Gupta brothers were drastic and would have had significant financial implications for the SABC.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
