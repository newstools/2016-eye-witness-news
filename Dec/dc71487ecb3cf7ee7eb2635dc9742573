JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Correctional Services says raids on 234 of its centres will continue well into the new year. Correctional Services says &quot;Operation Vala&quot; is in response to attempts in previous years by prisoners to try escape over the December holiday period.Various contraband, including dagga, home-made alcohol, kettles and television sets have been confiscated since the start of the operation this month. Correctional Services is also pleading with the public to avoid smuggling items into correctional facilities. The department's Logan Maistry says: Inmates are desperate to escape for various reasons which includes, amongst others, to participating in criminal activity or simply to be with family or friends. And it s for these reasons that special emphasis is placed on security measures in correctional centres, with increased visibility and involvement of managers at all levels in the operational activity.
