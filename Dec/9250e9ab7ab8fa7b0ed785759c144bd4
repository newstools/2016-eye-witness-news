A run-off will be held later this month if none of the two candidates secures more than half of the votes. JOHANNESBURG Vote counting has begun in Ghana s Parliamentary and presidential elections.President John Mahama is seeking a second term in a tight race against opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo, who he defeated four years ago.A run-off will be held later this month if none of the two candidates secures more than half of the votes.Lower global prices for Ghana s gold, oil and cocoa exports and a fiscal crisis caused the slowdown, which made Mahama s government vulnerable to a challenge from the main opposition leader, Akufo-Addo.For years, Ghana was one of Africa s most dynamic economies. But it slumped in 2014 as commodities prices fell, and a fiscal crisis widened the budget deficit and elevated inflation.Akufo-Addo s New Patriotic Party says the government has mismanaged national finances, including revenue from oil from an offshore field operated by British company Tullow that began to flow in 2010.The government denies this and urges voters to stick with it. It is following a $918 million International Monetary Fund programme to restore fiscal balance, and it says growth will return to above 8 percent in 2017 as new oil and gas from Tullow and ENI fields come on-stream. Every Ghanaian should exercise their civic responsibility and come out and vote. The destiny of our country depends on it, Mahama said as he cast his ballot in the town of Bole, Northern region.Counting started immediately after polls shut at 5 pm, but with around 29,000 polling stations, official results from the country s 275 constituencies across 10 regions are not expected until Thursday.A run-off between the top two candidates will follow if no candidate wins a majority.Ghana is considered a beacon of democracy in West Africa, with a history of peaceful elections. The government of the day has lost power twice since 2000.Akufo-Addo, a former foreign minister, voted in his home town of Kibi in the Eastern region, surrounded by supporters. It is my hope and my prayer for victory for myself and my party, he said, adding he was satisfied with voting so far.Results are expected within three days.
