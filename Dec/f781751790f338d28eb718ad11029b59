JOHANNESBURG Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he s prepared to testify under oath regarding the killing of his friend, allegedly by a member of the presidential protection unit.Mashaba spoke to Eyewitness News on the sidelines of the Salvation Early Childhood Development Centre launch in Soweto on Wednesday.Solly Moutlana died after he was knocked over, allegedly by the driver of a presidential protection unit vehicle in Pretoria last month.Mashaba said the only fact he had wrong on the death of his friend was the name of the hospital, but he maintained that every other statement was correct. I challenged her immediately to provide a statement under oath on what happened to Solly. Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu hit out at Mashaba, saying the man was admitted to the Pretoria District Hospital where he received medical attention before he died.Mashaba however maintains his friend waited three hours to receive medical attention. Before the accident, just before 12 o clock, he was immediately taken to hospital and what time did Solly die? The man responsible for the incident is being investigated for culpable homicide.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
