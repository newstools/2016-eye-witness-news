The party says it&#8217;s not fair to make the suspended National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega solely responsible for what took place at Marikana. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of the people (Cope) is calling for the police portfolio committee in Parliament to establish an inquiry into Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and then Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa s involvement in the Marikana massacre.The party says it s not fair to make the suspended National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega solely responsible for what took place at Marikana.Cope s Dennis Bloem says it s very clear that the government wants to make Phiyega the scapegoat and use her to cover-up for senior leaders in government.&quot;Phiyega was taking instructions from Nathi Mthethwa. That's why we are saying they must also account for the massacre.&quot;Bloem says they will not rest until they know the truth and that they need to get to the bottom of Mthethwa and Ramaphosa s involvement in the massacre.&quot;We will not stop, we will always ask for justice. It is not fair that Riah Phiyega nust carry the baton alone.&quot;(Edited by Zunaid Ismael)
