The acting SABC group CEO apologised for walking out of Parliament and requested to submit his responses in writing. CAPE TOWN - Acting South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Group Chief Executive Officer James Aguma has apologised for walking out of Parliament.On the first day of Parliament s SABC Ad Hoc Committee hearing Aguma, Hlaudi Motsoeneng and an SABC delegation ditched the committee proceedings. Aguma says they would like to submit their testimony to the board in writing: We d like to request that the committee allows us to give our responses in writing, because we ve listened to everybody and we do not want to repeat what has been said by other witnesses. Members of the Committee did not agree with this request.The African National Congress s Makhosi Khoza says: The gentlemen from SABC seems to be suggesting that the committee somehow needs to be debriefed of the information that they have received from witnesses. I want it to reject that statement with the contempt that it deserves. Democratic Alliance MP Phumzile van Damme says: We cannot make exceptions for them. They must come to Parliament, bring a written submission and allow the committee and the public to hear what they have to say. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
