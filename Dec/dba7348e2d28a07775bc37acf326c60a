The violence is the most serious bloodshed in Rakhine since communal clashes in 2012 that killed hundreds. JAKARTA Malaysia described the violence against Myanmar s Muslim Rohingya minority as ethnic cleansing on Saturday, ahead of a planned solidarity march in Kuala Lumpur expected to be led by Prime Minister Najib Razak.The strongly-worded statement came after Myanmar said on Friday that Malaysia should respect sovereign affairs and follow Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) policy of non-interference in other member countries internal affairs.

This practice must stop, and must be stopped immediately in order to bring back security and stability to the Southeast Asian region.
