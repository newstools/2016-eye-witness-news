JOHANNESBURG As hot to very hot weather conditions are expected to persist for the next month throughout the country, Johannesburg Water has urged residents to use water sparingly.The city has been under level two water restrictions despite the Vaal Dam rising from 27% to 37%.Johannesburg Water says it has experienced an increase in water consumption since the beginning of this month.Johannesburg Waters Tiidimalo Chuene says although water levels have risen in the various systems, the city is not in a position to lift water restrictions. We re still under level two water restriction because water supply has not risen up to a level where we can comfortably say there will be sufficient or constant supply for the long term. She says Johannesburg Water is expecting consumption levels to increase even further as temperatures increase. We ve already received quite a number of calls from people asking if they should be filling up their pools and unfortunately, with the water levels at this low state, it s not advisable. Chuene says Johannesburg Metro Police will continue to patrol around to city to keep an eye on water use.She has encouraged residents to report any cases they may come across.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
