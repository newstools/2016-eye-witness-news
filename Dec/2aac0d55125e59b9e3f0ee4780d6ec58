The City of Cape Town approved level three water restrictions, which came into effect on 1 November. CAPE TOWN - Capetonians are still using too much water, with water usage currently at just over 860 million litres per day, significantly more than the 800 million litre target.Dam levels are under 50%.Some locals have suggested water from run-offs from Table Mountain should be captured and stored.But applied climatologist Peter Johnston says it won't be feasible to start building dams as these run-offs provide too little water. There are really two options. You could use the water as it flows past you or to pump it out. I believe the city is using that water to water gardens. The City of Cape Town approved level three water restrictions, which came into effect on 1 November.Portable pools and garden hoses have been prohibited under level three water restrictions, while the City has strongly advised residents to install water efficient infrastructure in a bid to save as much water as possible.Water pressure is also set to be reduced in the water distribution system in a bid to limit underground leaks.Residents have been encouraged to visit the City of Cape Town s website for more information.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
