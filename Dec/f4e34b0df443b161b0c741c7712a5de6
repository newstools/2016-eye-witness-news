The power utility recently released the request for information to start its nuclear programme. JOHANNESBURG Energy expert Chris Yelland says government has not completed all planning processes for the nuclear build programme and he believes the request for proposals amounts to putting the cart before the horse.Eskom recently released the request for information to start its nuclear programme.Potential bidders Russia and France welcomed this development towards Eskom procuring 9.6 GW of nuclear energy.But Yelland says more needs to be done before requesting proposals. We have not done the integrated resource plan for electricity update yet. &quot;This is a plan that will try and establish whether we need nuclear at all in the mix and if so, how much we need, when do we need it, how much it s going to cost and how does it compare to the other options available.
