A judge ruled the 86-year-old Australian will be allowed to follow the trial at a court in London via video link from prison. LONDON Former television presenter and entertainer Rolf Harris has been told he won't have to attend his sex attack trial in Britain in person because of his age and health. In what's thought to be a legal first, the judge ruled the 86-year-old Australian national will be allowed to follow the trial at a court in London via video link from prison.Video links are frequently used to allow defendants being held in custody to follow preliminary hearings or for witnesses to give evidence. However, it s thought this could be the first time in a British court that a defendant has appeared at their own trial using the technology. Harris was jailed in 2014 to almost six years in prison for 12 indecent assaults on four girls. He s now pleaded not guilty to a further seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault dating back between 1971 and 2004. The trial is due to start next month.
