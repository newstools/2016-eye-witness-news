The utility has announced it will be launching its request for information on the project on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG Eskom has promised citizens that all proceedings will be transparent in its planned, controversial, nuclear project.The utility has announced it will be launching its request for information on the project on Thursday, which is different to a formal request for proposals.Two environmental groups are challenging the legality of the programme in court.The case was postponed on Wednesday, until February.Eskom s Khulu Phasiwe says the project will be done in accordance with the law. It would be foolhardy for anyone to try and do anything underhanded especially given the attention that has been focused on this project. He adds that rumours claiming that the highly controversial project has been exposed to corruption are false. This notion that already the Russians have the deal and other people are going to benefit, we don t know where it s coming from unless obviously it s coming from people who are against nuclear. Pahsiwe has further rubbished claims that the utility is displacing renewable energy sources, saying government requires a variety of sources to be included in the mix.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
