JOHANNESBURG - Bloomberg News is reporting that the Standard Bank group has asked the High Court to prevent President Jacob Zuma and any of his ministers from intervening in its decision to close bank accounts belonging to Gupta-linked companies.The legal bid was filed in the Pretoria High Court on Wednesday. In its affidavit, Standard Bank reportedly argues that ministerial threats to review South Africa s banking regulations and comments from Zuma that he is considering requests for a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the Gupta account closures have no legal basis.In October, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan approached the courts wanting an order stating that he has no authority to interfere in who banks choose as their clients. His move came after the Guptas repeatedly tried to pressure him into getting the banks to overturn their decision.Standard Bank has refused to comment further on an affidavit it filed in the High Court while the Presidency says it still hasn t heard from its lawyers regarding the matter.It appears the controversy surrounding bank accounts belonging to Gupta-linked companies is in more turmoil with Standard Bank now in support of Gordhan s application for an order that he cannot interfere with who banks choose as their clients. In emerged in court papers filed by Gordhan in October that members of the Gupta family and companies they control have been involved in suspicious transactions worth R6.8 billion.Now Standard Bank has filed an explosive affidavit in the High Court appealing for protection against the extensive political pressure it experienced from the ANC, cabinet ministers and Oakbay, after it closed the company s accounts.Standard Bank says the matter is now before the courts and is subjudice, while the Presidency says it will only comment once it s heard from President Jacob Zuma s lawyers.Meanwhile, Cabinet says it will only weigh in on the matter once the court has made a decision.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
