CAPE TOWN - Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) company secretary Theresa Geldenhuys has denied that she's backed any particular faction on the SABC board.The question was put to her by African National Congress (ANC) MP Hlomane Chauke. You now know that that board was divided. What was your role and which group did you belong to? Geldenhuys responded: With due respect Honourable Chauke, I do not belong to any fraction. My role is to remain completely independent of whatever goes on in the board. She s also told MPs she's sorry if she offended them by walking out of the parliamentary inquiry into the board's fitness for office last week.Geldenhuys was part of the SABC delegation, which included board chairperson Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe, that marched out of the hearings last week, after he complained that his constitutional rights were being violated. The only thing I can say, if it offended parliamentarians is apologise. I had stood with my chairperson Maguvhe in the fact that he felt that he was not being treated constitutionally. However, MPs were not convinced by Geldenhuys's apology. Maguvhe is the next witness in the hot seat.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
