SACP leader Blade Nzimande has questioned the relevance of the tripartite alliance relationship in this era. JOHANNESBURG South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande says the leadership succession in the African National Congress (ANC) is problematic.Nzimande was speaking at the Young Communist League s third national council which is underway in Soweto this weekend.He questioned the relevance of the tripartite alliance relationship in this era. Even under comrade Madiba we were still complaining We must make a decision and if we are an alliance we must act collectively. The SACP leader says factionalism is another big problem in the organisation. The ANC must learn to manage the transition in leadership. Is the ANC capable of doing that? If not they must come for help in the alliance. #YCLSA WATCH Nzimande on party factionalism. MK pic.twitter.com/nlxRVsGRK4
