There was no policy, we created the policy. In fact, when the BEE policy was framed we accused the DTI Department of stealing our formula because it had the broad-based element which is difficult to achieve, we did it simply because we were responding to the fact that women are not in the mainstream economy and so we had to go the difficult route of doing an IPO for women only. She adds: We could get away with it because that was 1996 and men could not take us to the Constitutional Court. It is fair to say 23 years later we are one of those few initial BEE companies that came from that time and we are still here to talk about our experiences.
