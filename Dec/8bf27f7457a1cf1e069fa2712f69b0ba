Zolani Sibeko has applied for bail in the Port Elizabeth High Court. CAPE TOWN - Judgment will be delivered today in the bail bid of one of the men implicated in Eastern Cape teacher Jayde Panayiotou's murder.Zolani Sibeko has applied for bail in the Port Elizabeth High Court.He is on trial along with Jayde s widower Christopher and Sinethemba Nenembe. The actual trial will continue next April.Sibeko believes the State has brought no evidence during the trial so far to prove that he had any role in Jayde s murder in April last year.The 35-year-old therefore believes the State does not have a strong case against him.Sibeko was arrested in July after cellphone records placed him in the vicinity of the slain teacher's home, along with the alleged hitman, in the days leading up to her killing.Prosecutor Marius Stander has however called on the court to dismiss the bail application.Stander has argued the accused faces a schedule six offence, which means the onus is on him to prove that there are exceptional circumstances to justify his release on bail.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
