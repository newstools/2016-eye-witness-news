The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. BEIJING - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media.The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on 20 November to address the issue.&quot;The units we've analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,&quot; an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue.The US tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7.But domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups.The Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015.&quot;The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,&quot; said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys.State media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety.&quot;I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,&quot; said Mr Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing.&quot;The news did make me change my Apple habits,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.&quot;
