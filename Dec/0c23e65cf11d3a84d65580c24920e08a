Yesterday, the Western Cape High Court struck the chairperson&#8217;s application off the roll. CAPE TOWN The Parliamentary inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board s fitness to hold office will go ahead after its chairperson failed to obtain a court interdict.Yesterday, the Western Cape High Court struck the chairperson s application off the roll.Mbulaheni Maguvhe, the only remaining non-executive board member, wanted the court to set aside a subpoena to appear before the ad-hoc committee.Lawyers for Maguvhe argued the ad-hoc committee would have been biased against their client because some Members of Parliament have expressed public views about the board.But Judge Siraj Desai did not agree with their contention. I make the following order; the application is dismissed. The first applicant to pay the costs, reasons to follow at later stage. Advocate Denzil Potgieter for Parliament described Maguvhe s claim of partiality as a preemptive strike.He said his lawyers did not provide evidence to support this claim. Desai had described the board as non-functional and non-existent with Maguvhe as the last man standing .Ad-hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith said the application was a waste of time. I don t think they had a leg to stand on. I think it was an exercise of delaying and the arguments raised by the applicants didn t have anything of substance. Smith added he expects Maguvhe to abide by the court s ruling. I do expect the chair of the board and everybody who feels they might be adversely affected to be here to hear firsthand so they can t argue that they were spoken about in their absence. The inquiry is expected to kick off in Parliament sometime next week.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
