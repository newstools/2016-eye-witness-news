This is largely due to increases in community services, trade, construction and mining industries. JOHANNESBURG - The quarterly employment statistics for the third quarter of 2016 show that employment has increased by just 1% with a total of 93,000 additional jobs created.This is largely due to increases in community services, trade, construction and mining industries.However, jobs in the electricity industry remain unchanged.Meanwhile, gross earnings has gone up by 3.9% in the same quarter.Senior economist at Nedbank Isaac Matshego says the numbers are encouraging. After two consecutive quarters of job losses in the former non-agricultural sector, we ve seen job creation. But Lesiba Mothata, Investment Solutions chief economist, says these statistics are different compared to the report release on employment three weeks ago. We are looking at companies registered for VAT. It s a version of nonfarm payroll, which excludes the agricultural sector and is a more accurate look through in terms of what companies are doing in terms of payroll. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
