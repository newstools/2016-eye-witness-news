The police minister says the new training programme ensures police recruits are equipped to carry out their duties. PRETORIA Police Minister Nathi Nhleko says the new Back to Basics training programme ensures police recruits are equipped to carry out their duties in a democratic country. The minister and acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane presided over a graduation ceremony in Pretoria West on Thursday. The event was one of several held around the country which will see nearly 5,000 new constables being deployed to police stations to finish their training. Nhleko says the new training programme better equips new recruits. The training programme has been put in place to ensure that SAPS members are equipped with the necessary tools to police in a democratic dispensation. Phahlane says the recruits will immediately get down to work. Adding 5,000 new police officials to the team will ensure that the South African Police Service will be visible all over the country this festive season. The recruits will spend the next year at police stations as constables before their training is completed.WATCH: New SAPS graduates are ready for anythingPhahlane says the recruits have already started their operations training. Our new recruits have over the past few weeks been deployed in malls and shopping centres in Gauteng. They have already experienced the reality of policing. Nhleko told the recruits that their police careers have officially started. You can make an immediate and visible contribution to policing on a daily basis, starting of course with this festive season. The security of our people and their property is now in your hands. The constables will spend one year on probation and will be based at police stations across the country.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
