The former group executive for risk and governance, Itani Tseisi, told MPs the SABC board was far from a well-oiled machine. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)'s former group executive for risk and governance, Itani Tseisi, says the broadcaster's financial future looks bleak, because the board failed to implement recommended risk management plans. Poor corporate governance, ineffective executive committee, inability of the corporation to achieve its strategic objectives, inability to meet shareholder expectations, and loss of credibility. Tseisi, who left the SABC about two months ago, is briefing Parliament's ad hoc committee which is looking into the board's fitness to hold office.He's told MPs the board was far from a well-oiled machine. There would be approvals that were kept in the dark from other board members and inadequate knowledge of the SABC business. He says when he recommended risk management strategies to the board, none of the plans were implemented.MPs have also heard a delay in the implementation of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) is one of the biggest external risks facing the SABC.Tseisi says the SABC s financial stability is in jeopardy because the board failed to implement long-term risk management plans.He says an increase in competition is another big external risk facing the broadcaster. The delay in DTT implementation will no doubt affect the SABC and the increasing costs of sports runs which at some point will push the SABC out of sports of national interests.
