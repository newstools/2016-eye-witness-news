JOHANNESBURG Two people have been killed in an accident on the N1 North in Hammanskraal resulting in delays of up to an hour on that stretch of highway.Emergency Management Services (EMS) say the accident was caused by a bakkie that broke down in the slow lane.Five people survived the accident seemingly unscathed.EMS spokesperson Johan Pietersson says police are now busy with clearing the road. The bakkie s trailer broke down in the slow lane. A horse and carriage came past the bakkie and I think the driver only realised once he was at the vehicle that the vehicle was not moving. He swerved but the back trailer caught the trailer of the bakkie and then the chaos of the accident. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
