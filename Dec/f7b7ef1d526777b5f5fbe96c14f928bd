JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says it notes the reports about its leadership with dismay, saying it has unjustifiably been accused of lack of accountability. In a written response to a parliamentary question, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has criticised Sars, saying he could not verify whether or not it had any specialised investigating units similar to the now disbanded high-risk unit.This is because of a lack of accountability and co-operation from Sars top management. Sars has released a statement saying it finds no inspiration to engage the Finance Minister via the media, but has assured that the leadership of the revenue service is committed to a professional working relationship with National Treasury. In the light of Gordhan's comments this week, Sars says it has met the Finance Minister eight times since he took office to discuss issues of mutual interest and at no point did he express a lack of confidence in its leadership.Sars says all submissions to the minister or parliamentary committee have always been honest, truthful and factual, with no record from the minister to date requesting it to verify any information provided.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
