The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union has reacted to an attack at PE prison in which 3 inmates were killed. CAPE TOWN - The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) says attacks on prison guards come as a result of understaffing and overcrowding at correctional centres.The union was reacting to an incident in which three inmates were killed and 26 others critically injured at St Albans prison in Port Elizabeth on Monday.Popcru's Richard Mamabolo says prisoners were fully aware of the limited number of correctional officials on duty at the time of the attack on warders. The population has increased to 150,000 inmates across the country. There are normally 26,000 officials who take care of their needs and ensure that all prisons are self-sustainable, instead of what we have now where everything is put up for tender. Authorities say inmates at the St Albans correctional facility will not be allowed any visits from family or friends, possibly until next year.At least three investigations are now underway into the incident.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
