Sipho Pityana also spoke of how some have found the UCT environment alienating and marginalising. CAPE TOWN University of Cape Town (UCT) council chairperson Sipho Pityana says the university s management has to do more to ensure the institution is transformed and inclusive. Pityana addressed the university community during a graduation ceremony on Tuesday, where he mentioned that the UCT student body demographic has drastically changed since 1994. He also spoke of how some have found the UCT environment alienating and marginalising. Pityana says this has to change. Our approach to everything we do as an institution should have changed similarly from teaching and learning, to research, student life, our community outreach and others. He adds the transformation agenda has to take into account the changing demographic student body. And realising that the staff compliment must also change. This must take on board the diversity of the cultures, values, heritage and epistemology of students and staff. This will also be reinforced through appropriate display of artwork symbols, names of buildings and use of indigenous South African languages. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
