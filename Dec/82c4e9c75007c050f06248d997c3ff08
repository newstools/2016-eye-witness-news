Dudu Myeni &amp; her board had been dragged to court by the authority&#8217;s suspended CEO Sibusiso Makhanya. JOHANNESBURG Dudu Myeni will have to step down as chairperson of the Mhlathuze Water Authority board after a court in KwaZulu-Natal ruled that the board is unlawful.The Pietermaritzburg High Court has ordered Water Affairs and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane dismiss the board headed by Myeni because its mandate had expired last year.Myeni and her board had been dragged to court by the authority s suspended CEO Sibusiso Makhanya who accused Myeni of capturing the water authority.Through his court papers, Makhanya told the court of how Mokonyane extended the board s service by six months after it had expired. The court heard that, once the six months was done, the minister then extended the board s life indefinitely. But Judge Yvonne Mbatha found that the board s extensions were unlawful and invalid. Mbatha said the decision was done with absolutely no legal provision and therefore Makhanya s suspension as CEO, ordered by Myeni was also unlawful. Makhanya also brought forward allegations before the court that Myeni had suspended him because he was not giving her the authority s tenders. However Judge Mbatha dismissed these statement as scandalous.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
