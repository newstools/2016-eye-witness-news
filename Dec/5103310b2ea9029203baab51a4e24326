CAPE TOWN - One of the men implicated in the murder of Jayde Panayiotou has been denied bail in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Zolani Sibeko applied for bail last week because he believed the State did not have a strong case against him. The trial against Sibeko, alleged wife killer Christopher Panayiotou and Sinethemba Nenembe resumes in April 2017. Judge Irma Schoeman said that exceptional circumstances needed to exist in order to release Sibeko on bail. Sibeko s defence counsel unsuccessfully argued that the State had not proven he had any role in Panayiotou s killing in April 2015. The 35-year-old s been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Sibeko was arrested in July after cellphone plotting evidence placed him with the alleged hitmen, in the vicinity of Panayiotou's residence in the days leading up to her death.
