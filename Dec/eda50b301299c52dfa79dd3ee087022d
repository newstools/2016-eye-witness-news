The Automobile Association says the petrol price could increase by 51 cents in January. JOHANNESBURG - The Automobile Association (AA) has predicted that the petrol price will increase by 51 cents in January.The AA says the rise in fuel prices has been influenced by the weak rand against the dollar during this month and the continued upward spiral in the petroleum price.Diesel is expected to increase by 40 cents, while illuminating paraffin will go up by 43 cents. The AA s Layton Beard says 2017 is going to be a tough time for motorists. It's too early to know at what price level oil supply will match demand in the wake of the OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) decision to cut production. We do believe that 2017 will be a difficult year for motorists. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
