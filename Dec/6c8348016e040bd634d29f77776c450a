Political parties have reacted to Mbulaheni Maguvhe&#8217;s resignation from the SABC board on Monday. CAPE TOWN The African National Congress (ANC) says its unfortunate Mbulaheni Maguvhe chose to sacrifice his reputation and professional integrity before fixing the issues at the SABC.He was the sole remaining member of the board following a series of resignations earlier this year.In a written statement released by the ANC s Parliamentary Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu says Maguvhe s delays only caused further damage to the broadcaster s governance.Mthembu says it took a painfully long time for Maghuve to step down, but he believes his exit will speed up the process of addressing the leadership crisis at the SABC.The Presidency this afternoon confirmed it had accepted Maghuve's resignation.Last week Maghuve struggled to defend claims of censorship, political interference and intimidation at the public broadcaster raised in a parliamentary probe.He only appeared before the ad hoc parliamentary committee after losing a court bid to stop it and staging a walkout on the first day it sat.The parliamentary committee says it feels vindicated by the resignation.At the same time, the Congress of the People (Cope) is calling for Hlaudi Motsoeneng s head to roll following the resignation of Maguvhe.Maguvhe was a staunch and vocal supporter of the former SABC Chief Executive Officer.Cope s Dennis Bloem says this is a good start, but it s time for Motsoeneng to fall on his sword too. This is long overdue Maguvhe has wasted a lot of the taxpayers money to challenge Parliament s ad hoc committee. Hlaudi Motsoeneng must now follow in the footsteps of Maguvhe and also resign because his time is up. Meanwhile, Director of Media Monitoring Africa William Bird says the resignation is long overdue, and while it s welcome, it is not the end of the story. Their (the interim board) basic task will be to bring some kind of stability to the SABC. At the same time they will have to launch all manner of investigations to start to investigate appointment processes and dodgy deals. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
