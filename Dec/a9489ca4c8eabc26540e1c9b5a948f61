CAPE TOWN - Media freedom lobby group Right2Know has called for Communications Minister Faith Muthambi to step down or be removed following allegations of her interference in the affairs of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).The civil organisation says those entrusted to look after the public broadcaster have shown disrespect for the country and its citizens.The ad hoc committee investigating the SABC board this week heard how Muthambi allegedly undermined SABC s independence.Right2Know is set to make submissions to the ad hoc committee on Wednesday.The civil society organisation says it will reiterate its call for the so-called one-man board consisting only of chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe to be dissolved.It also points out that evidence before the committee, that Muthambi allegedly forced Hlaudi Motsoeneng s unlawful appointment, is further proof that the minister should be fired.Several political parties including the Democratic Alliance and Congress of the People have long called for the board to be dissolved.Meanwhile, Parliament has confirmed summons have been issued for Maguvhe to appear before the committee on Tuesday.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
