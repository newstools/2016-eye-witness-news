LONDON The family of the registered driver of the cargo truck that killed 12 people when it ploughed through a crowd at a Christmas market in Berlin say they fear he was kidnapped by the perpetrator and killed in the bloodbath.Police have confirmed that the truck was stolen from a construction site before the Nice-style massacre and a polish man s body was discovered inside the polish registered truck.Officials in Berlin are investigating the contacts and associates of the man believed to be behind Monday night's deadly attack. Although one person described as the co-driver died at the scene, German police are now trying to establish who else might have been involved. The lorry was registered in neighbouring Poland and the authorities will want to verify if anyone beyond the attackers helped them stage the atrocity.The fear is that with a series of defeats being suffered by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, terrorist leaders are encouraging radicalised Europeans to return to their home countries and commit attacks there. Meanwhile, Berlin police said on Twitter on Tuesday that investigators assume that the driver of a truck did so intentionally. Our investigators assume that the truck was deliberately steered into the crowd at the Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz, police said.They also said that a man found dead in the truck was not controlling it.It seems highly likely security will be stepped up at large events in the run up to New Year.
