I don t like the position I find myself in. Every time we convene to talk about budgets they ask if we ve figured out another place we re going cut. Every time they announce they say they ll tax people more. Argon Asset Management economist Thabi Leoka was also part of the discussion. She says 'white privilege' continues to widen the inequality gap, which has a detrimental effect on the economy. The sad fact is that most black people don t know the political side of this.
