Nomvuyo Treffers created the product due to frustration at the lack of good quality swimming caps for people with afros, braids, dreadlocks or naturally curly hair.Treffers, who has dreadlocks, says the product was created for people like her who have never enjoyed swimming because there was no adequate protection for their hair.&quot;People didn't only just order, they'd give feedback and tell us that they've given up on swimming.
