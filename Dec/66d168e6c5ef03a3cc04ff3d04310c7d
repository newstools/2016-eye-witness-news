The probe relates to two incidents which occurred during McBride's term as Ekurhuleni metro police chief almost a decade ago. JOHANNESBURG On Monday Robert McBride was supposed to appear before the Hawks to provide a warning statement as part of an investigation against him for defeating or obstructing the ends of justice, but was a no-show.The probe relates to two incidents which occurred during his term as Ekurhuleni metro police chief almost a decade ago.McBride believes telephonic recordings that emerged earlier this month, suggesting that Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and senior Hawks investigators had been conspiring to find dirt against him, have everything to do with him now being investigated.He s accused the directorate for priority crime investigation of not acting in the interests of justice.But Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi insists the investigation against Mcbride has nothing to do with the police minister. We must desist and resist from using the name of the minister, but deal with the issues at hand. The Hawks say they take serious exception to McBride s refusal to present himself as requested, and will take the issue up with his lawyers.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
