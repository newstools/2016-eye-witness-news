The Constitution is the birth certificate of the democratic South Africa; it provides the foundation for the existence of the democratic South Africa.Earlier he signed a constitutional pledge. President Zuma has called on South Africans to regard the Constitution as a previous heritage that has served as a guide for the country.He says the Constitution remains a pillar for the country. Fellow South Africans, our Constitution is our precious heritage and it has been an excellent guide in the journey of building a new national democratic society in the past 20 years of its existence. ZUMA FAILED TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTIONIn March, the Constitutional Court found that President Zuma failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.He was then ordered to pay back a portion of the money used for upgrades at his Nkandla home, which he later took out a loan from a Limpopo bank for.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said remedial action was binding and Zuma's compliance was not optional.&quot;No binding and constitutionally or statutory liaisons decision may be disregarded 'willy-nilly'.&quot;He said Zuma was entitled to inquire into the correctness of those aspects of the report he disagreed with.&quot;All the president was required to do was to comply, even if he had reason to doubt its correctness.&quot;Mogoeng said the Public Protector's office must be independent.&quot;It is supposed to protect the public from any conduct in state affairs or in any sphere of government that could result in any impropriety or prejudice.The Public Protector is thus one of the most invaluable Constitutional gifts to our nation in the fight against corruption.&quot;He said the ruling dealt with issues of great importance to South Africans and the well-being of the country's Constitutional democracy.Judges took just over a month to weigh up arguments from the EFF, the Democratic Alliance (DA), the National Assembly speaker and the then Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.Zuma had previously refused to pay back the money saying Madonsela's orders, which she made in her report entitled 'Secure in Comfort' two years ago, were merely recommendations.The president spent R246 million on non-security features at his Nkandla home in KwaZulu-Natal.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
