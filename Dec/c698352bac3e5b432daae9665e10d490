President Jacob Zuma has asked the Pretoria High Court to set aside the State of Capture report. JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma has asked the Pretoria High Court to set aside the State of Capture report.Zuma's lawyers argue it is unconstitutional for the Public Protector to tell him to set up a commission to decide for it to be a judicial one and who should chair it.In his application, the president apparently wants the court to review and set aside the remedial action stated in the State of Capture report.Presidency spokesperson Bongani Nqulunga has confirmed that the president has indeed filed papers at the High Court in Pretoria asking the court to review and set aside remedial actions contained in the state of capture report.Among the recommendations were that the chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should appoint a judge to chair a commission of inquiry into allegations made in the report.Zuma said in his founding affidavit that the remedial action was unlawful as it straddles the separation of powers doctrine.Last week, the president announced he will be taking the remedial action in the Public Protector s report on review.
