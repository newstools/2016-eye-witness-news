The Western Cape High Court also ruled against the association s application to have the event go ahead.The association s CEO Kevin Momberg said, Each party is doing their thing, discussing behind the scenes and documents and things not in court yet. Obviously the outcome we d like to see is both parties having a win-win situation. The city s Eddie Andrews says they re considering applications from several groups, including the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Assosiasie. The committee convened this week to process those applications and the permits will be issued if the event organising team is compliant.
