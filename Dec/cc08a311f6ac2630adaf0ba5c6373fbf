The City of Ekurhuleni says it had already last week rejected a request for a fireworks display at Dries Niemandt Park. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg High Court has granted an interdict to the Kempton Park SPCA to prevent a fireworks display at Dries Niemandt Park.The New Year s extravaganza announced by the municipality on Wednesday came under fire from residents and the SPCA who say they are disappointed with the city s apparent lack of consideration for animals. The City of Ekurhuleni has welcomed the interdict, saying it had already rejected a request by the organisers to set off the explosives last week because of the park s proximity to a residential area. Spokesperson Themba Gadebe said, Our rejection came when pre-programmed social media messages were already out. Residents can rest assured that we have not granted permission for this.&quot;But Kempton Park councillor Simon Lapping insists proper processes were not followed by the municipality. The Kempton Park SPCA was not given adequate opportunity to address this issue during normal working hours. The municipality has urged residents to look after all animals during New Year s Eve celebrations and to comply with its fireworks by-laws.
