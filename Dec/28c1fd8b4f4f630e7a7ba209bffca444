JOHANNESBURG - The North West Education and Sport Development Department says it is going to increase security at all its schools after one of them was torched on Wednesday. The department says it believes the people who torched the four classrooms and an administration block at Phogole Primary School were initially there to steal smart tablets. The department's Freddy Sepeng says it is saddened by the act and says the damage to the school has been estimated at R2 million. Sepeng says preliminary investigations have found a similar method to gain entry was used at a previous school where tablets were stolen earlier in the year. We re monitoring all the schools, even though the department is trying its best to tighten security. We also plan to provide temporary classrooms. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
