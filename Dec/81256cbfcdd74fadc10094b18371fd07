Gert van der Merwe represents the Gupta family and has been speaking on their behalf in public. JOHANNESBURG The attorney representing the Gupta family says he needs to consult with them before he can make any comment about a claim from the Amabhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism that they have been laundering millions of rand through a series of letter-box companies.The centre says it has proof that millions of rand went through these firms and that the South African Reserve Bank eventually froze some of the payments.Earlier this year, it emerged that the Financial Intelligence Centre had flagged transactions linked to the Guptas totalling R6.8 billion as suspicious.Gert van der Merwe represents the Gupta family and has been speaking on their behalf in public.But he says he needs to consult with the family about these claims before he can give any kind of response.Amabhungane says it has proof that a letter-box company called Homix was used to move money around.It says that at one point this company received a payment of R41 from Neotel when it had no capacity to provide the kind of service Neotel was supposedly paying for.It says this suggests that Neotel was simply being forced to pay a bribe or a toll to get a contract from Transnet.LISTEN: Guptas use groups of companies to launder moneyAmaBhungane s Stefaans Brummer says they were able to track how many went from Neotel to Homix, and Neotel then got a Transnet contract. We found a lot of other money also flowing through Homix onwards to uncertain destinations, some of it we saw coming to a company in Hong Kong, which shared an address with companies belonging to a Gupta associate. And he says it doesn t make sense that Homix would be paid R42 million when it doesn t have any particular expertise or a proper headquarters. A company that, as we found, was hidden behind a blue door next to the gents in a rundown office block. The Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
