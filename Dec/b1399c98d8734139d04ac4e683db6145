In a written response to a parliamentary question, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan criticised Sars. JOHANNESBURG - Head of the Davis Tax Committee Judge Dennis Davis has dismissed claims that Sars is not co-operating with Treasury.In a written response to a parliamentary question, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan criticised Sars, saying he could not verify if it had any specialised investigating units similar to the disbanded high-risk unit.However, Sars says its dismayed by the minister s remarks because its met with him on several occasions and has always co-operated.Supposed tensions between Sars Tom Moyane and the Minister Gordhan have been widely reported on but Davis says he would not want to be drawn into personal issues. There s been no suggestion of lack of cooperation and to be honest the issues in the newspapers, which I know journalists are very excited about, are not my job and I don t want to get drawn into personal issues and disciplinary processes.
