Gauteng Hawks boss Prince Mokotedi details plots to murder the country&#8217;s police bosses and bring about the downfall of the president in an affidavit. JOHANNESBURG - Details of an alleged secret meeting to plot the murder of the country s police bosses, an Arab Spring-type uprising and the downfall of the president have been revealed in an explosive affidavit authored by the Gauteng Hawks head. General Prince Mokotedi has opened a case against Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride, former Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya, private investigator Paul O Sullivan and crime intelligence officer Candice Coetzee. They are accused of conspiracy to commit murder, treason, espionage and several other crimes. General Mokotedi alleges that earlier in December, the four individuals held a braai at Radovan Krejcir s former house in Bedfordview, which is now owned by O Sullivan, and identified individuals for vexatious criminal investigations and shaming in the media. They targeted these people because they supported President Jacob Zuma. It s believed members of AfriForum and the Democratic Alliance were also party to the discussions. It was apparently resolved that O Sullivan would dig up dirt on the individuals as well as on the president s son Duduzane Zuma and this information would be used to mobilize an Arab Spring-type revolt in the country. A separate meeting was allegedly held at the Michaelangelo Hotel in March with Serbian nationals and Zimbabwean intelligence officials as a plot was apparently hatched to assassinate Mokotedi and Ntlemeza. This latest development is an escalation in the ongoing bitter battle within the country s law enforcement authorities.
