EFF leader Julius Malema says white people have damaged the lives of black people &amp; are to blame for drug abuse amongst them. JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says white people are responsible for unemployment, illiteracy and drug abuse amongst black people and has warned that if they don t return what belongs them, there will be an outburst.Malema was addressing the party s memorial service in honour of Cuba s former President Fidel Castro, who died at the weekend.Malema says white people have damaged the lives of black people. We re unemployed because of them. We re dying of diseases because of them. We re illiterate because of them. We ve surrendered to drugs because of you. You owe us a lot. He says if whites don t return what belongs to blacks, there will be problems. One day we re going to have an outburst. He told his supporters to speak out freely about whites and the land and never to feel like they owe whites an apology. RUN SA LIKE CUBAMalema says the formation of his party and its policies were inspired by Castro and he s told supporters that when the red berets take over government they will make the country exactly like Cuba.He says through his socialist policies, Castro brought unemployment in Cuba down to 3% and hiked literacy levels to 93%.Malema also praised Castro for his role in liberating South Africa. If it was not because of Fidel Castro, most African countries were not going to be liberated. It was the people of Cuba who deliberately came to help African people to liberate themselves. Malema says only the EFF has the right to celebrate Castro s life and not the African National Congress as it hasn t achieved anything that comes close to what he did.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
