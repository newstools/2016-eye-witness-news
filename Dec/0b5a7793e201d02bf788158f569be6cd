Aerios owns the commercial rights at Newlands Stadium and is attempting to stop a liquidation order. CAPE TOWN Western Province Rugby and marketing company Aerios are in court over the rugby union s commercial arms application for liquidation. Aerios owns the commercial rights at Newlands Stadium and is attempting to stop the liquidation order, because it claims Western Province owes it in excess of R70 million.Both sides have had their say to Judge Ashley Binns-Ward.An advocate for Aerios has argued that Western Province s liquidation has 'ulterior purposes' and is an attempt to get out of contracts signed in 2011 and 2014. Aerios believes the rugby union s commercial arm has not held up its end of the contract which handed the company control of commercial and advertising rights at Newlands.The company has pointed out a court order in August instructing Western Province to include it in all commercial negotiations.Aerios says this has not been adhered to.(Edited by Neo Koza)
