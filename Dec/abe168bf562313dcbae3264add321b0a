MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba says her department is concerned about these kinds of pastors. JOHANNESBURG - Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba says while she appreciates religion and respects people s rights, she cannot fold her arms and watch the killing of others in the name of religion.Ramathuba has reacted to Prophet Rufus Phala from the AK Spiritual Christian Church who told his congregation to drink Dettol for the healing of sicknesses.Ramathuba says her department is concerned about these pastors, with Phala being the second church leader whose sparked an outcry for their religious practices.In November photographs emerged of Pastor Lethebo Rabalago spraying Doom insecticide in the faces of his congregantsThe health MEC says they are dealing with these matters seriously. This is a disinfectant that we use in our households and it was meant to kill germs just like Doom was meant to kill insects. We are really worried because we ve been seeing stories of what is happening that you end up many of our people in ICU. But the AK Spiritual Church leader says he anointed the anti-septic liquid just like Jesus who turned water into wine. When I drank it, it was pineapple juice. One man was using crutches but after drinking it, he stood up and walked. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
