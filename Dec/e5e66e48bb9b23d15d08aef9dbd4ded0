Masibulele Maqetuka and his partner were having a meal at the Bungalow restaurant when their bill identified them as &quot;2 blacks&quot;. CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town resident who was at the centre of a race row involving a Clifton restaurant has accepted the eatery s apology.Masibulele Maqetuka and his partner were having a meal at the Bungalow restaurant over the weekend when their bill arrived and identified them as &quot;2 blacks&quot;.He posted a snapshot on social media that went viral.He says he has since learnt that the waiter who served the table has been suspended pending an internal investigation. Seeing his interview, I kind of felt sorry for him because I understand that as breadwinner of the family and he could now lose his job but it still doesn t take away the fact that he shouldn t have done what he did. It s unfortunate that the matter has gotten to this stage. The Capetonian says he won t be visiting the popular eating spot again.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
