Warning: This article contains strong language which some may find offensive.JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has called on the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to investigate racist comments allegedly posted by a Sandton man regarding the Durban beachfront.Ben Sasonof caused a stir on social media over the weekend after he made crude comments about black beachgoers and the president. Sasonof also hit back at one detractor, directly calling them a monkey and denying that he's racist. Sanco says Sasonof must be dealt with in the harshest possible way.The organisation says black people are being continually subjected to racist and white supremacist behaviour, especially at this time of the year.&quot;We're outraged because almost every year at this time we're confronted by this matter. We know this seeks to rekindle racial hatred.&quot;The organisation says in addition to the SAHRC investigation, Sasonof must be held criminally liable for his comments.&quot;We believe if perpetrators are not dealt with harshly it has the propensity to undermine reconciliation.&quot;The African National Congress Youth League has also indicated it will be laying criminal charges against Sasonof.LISTEN: How should SA deal with racists?This comes after former KwaZulu-Natal estate agent Penny Sparrow was charged with crimen injuria for comparing black people on a Durban beach to monkeys.She delivered a teary apology in the Scottsburg Magistrates Court three months ago, where she pleaded guilty and vowed to work towards making South Africa a better place to live in.
