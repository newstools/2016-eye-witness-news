We have realised that fatigue plays a big role. During the weekend a taxi smashed into a bus in the Western Cape, killing at least 13 of its occupants.Meanwhile, the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) is calling for harsh punishment to drivers who are found guilty of breaking the rules of the road.Sanco says the Road Traffic Management Corporation, together with the judicial services, should take it upon themselves to make roads safer by removing those who cause injuries and fatalities.Sanco s Gauteng chairperson Chris Malematja says the increasing number of fatalities on South African roads this festive season are caused by drivers who know they may get away with breaking the law. Let those who are found to be on the other side of the law, specifically on the speed, [face] the harsh sentence. We are calling for their licence to be taken.
