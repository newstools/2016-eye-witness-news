JOHANNESBURG South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande says the party will continue to contribute to the African National Congress (ANC), for now, by playing its role in the alliance, but at the same time will work independently towards building a working-class-led movement to advance the national democratic revolution.

The SACP will convene a national imbizo to bring together mass democratic forces to discuss challenges facing our country.
