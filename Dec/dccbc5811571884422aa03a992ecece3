In 2012, police union Popcru accused Khomotso Phahlane, a then forensic services divisional commissioner, of corruption. JOHANNESBURG - Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane has released an independent forensic audit which clears him of allegations of corruption within the forensic services division. The allegations are the basis of recent claims that the lieutenant general built a luxury house in the north of Pretoria with the proceeds of kickbacks. In 2012, police union Popcru accused Phahlane, who was then a forensic services divisional commissioner, of corruption related to the procurement of chemicals and supplies for the division. Suspended national commissioner Riah Phiyega ordered the probe, but despite receiving the report in 2014 which cleared Phahlane, it was never made public. Phahlane says the chemicals tender and numerous other allegations were investigated and he was cleared. As made visible in this report, it is an allegation which was found to be not correct and unsubstantiated. The very same person who is running together with Paul O Sullivan, Colonel [Sandragasen] Moonsamy, was unable to substantiate his allegations. He says the allegations were made by three whistleblowers. All three being Popcru members and serving in the forensic services division, they were also at the time under investigation in a disciplinary matter which had to be put on hold on a request of Popcru when their allegations were investigated.
