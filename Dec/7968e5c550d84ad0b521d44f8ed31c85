JOHANNESBURG The Hawks have issued a warning to shoppers about an increase in ATM card-swapping fraud this festive season.The elite investigative unit says card scammers are most likely to hit during this time of the year.A 49-year-old man, who s already behind bars at Port Elizabeth's St Alban's prison, was charged by the Hawk's Serious Commercial Crime unit for fraud. He is believed to be part of a card-swapping syndicate operating in Port Elizabeth. Thirteen of its suspected members have been arrested since December 2015.The Hawk's Anelisa Feni says this type of crime is prevalent this time of the year. Do not allow anyone to help you while performing a transaction from an ATM. Only receive help from the staff of the bank. If the card is swallowed by the machine, immediately call the number on the machine. Feni says this will allow you to stop any further transactions. Card swapping and the withdrawal of the cash all happens in a few minutes. Phone the number immediately to cancel the card in order to prevent loss. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
