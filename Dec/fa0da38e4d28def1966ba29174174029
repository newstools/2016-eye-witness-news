JOHANNESBURG - South African tennis star Kevin Anderson says he looking forward to what he hopes will be a successful 2017 season, following a disappointing and injury-riddled 2016 that saw him slip down the ATP World Rankings.Anderson has been in South Africa for a number of weeks, after a three year absence, recovering from a hip injury he suffered before the Paris Masters, and has recently gotten into the swing of things, as he looks to get ready for the new year.The 30-year-old spent much of his 2016 nursing light knocks and niggles instead of playing tennis and found himself crashing out of competitions in the first rounds.He s hoping to regain the form that saw him grab headlines in 2015 and that also saw him shoot up to a career-high top 10 in the world. I picked up a hip injury right before the end of the season, which put me out of the Paris Masters series. It s been a lengthy recovery, almost 6 weeks, but I m excited to be back on the court for 4 or 5 days now. It looks encouraging and it looks like I ll be back strong at the beginning of next year. 2015 was one of my best years reaching top 10 and around September was one of my career highlights. I had ambitions to start this year strong and improve on 2015, but I didn t give myself the opportunity to play consistently. Anderson says he has no intentions of retiring from the sport anytime soon, adding that he still has at least four or five more years in him. I feel strong and believe that once I get through that I ll be back to where I want to be physically. I feel fresh and I feel like there are still some things I want to achieve in my career.
