The Bone Marrow Registry says the existing number of 74,000 donors needs to increase in the number of black, Asian and coloured donors. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Bone Marrow Registry (SABMR) has repeated calls for more stem cell donors.It says the current pool of 74,000 donors needs to increase in the number of black, Asian and other racial groups, to give patients suffering from leukaemia and other life-threatening blood-related diseases a higher chance of finding the perfect match.Currently the chances of finding an unrelated match is at one 1,000.The SABMR s Charlotte Ingram says Most people may have family member that will be able to donate the bone marrow to them but only about 30% of people will find a match in their family then the other 70% will have to look outside of that. The registry is particularly wanting to raise awareness of the need for black, coloured and Asian donors.Ingram says with the diverse background of genetic types in South Africa, it has become difficult to match somebody of mixed ethnicity . Available to us on the world s bone marrow registry are about 28 million donors. South Africa only has 74,000 and 80% of those are actually white donors. To register you can contact the sunflower fund responsible for the recruitment on 0800121082 or visit their website. The age requirement to register is 18 45 years, and donors up to 60 years of age are still able to donate bone marrow.Upon registration, two test tubes of blood will be taken from the arm. The blood is tested to identify tissue type and the results are sent to the SABMR to be placed on the local registry and international database.A donor s personal details are kept anonymous. The SABMR will only contact potential donors if they are a potential match.
