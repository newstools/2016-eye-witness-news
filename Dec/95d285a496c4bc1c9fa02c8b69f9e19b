She told members of Parliament (MPs) she wants to bolster efforts to ensure proposed remedial action is adhered to.Mkhwebane says the Public Protector's Office is beefing up its legal centre, which will work in conjunction with the compliance manager. Instead of implementing our recommendations, the SABC board went further and asked for a legal opinion without engaging on each remedial action.
