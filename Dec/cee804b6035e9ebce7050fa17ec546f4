Eskom&#8217;s newly appointed acting CEO Matshela Koko says he has a job to do &amp; he's not concerned about being appointed in a permanent capacity. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom s newly appointed acting CEO Matshela Koko says he has a job to do and whether or not he s appointed in a permanent capacity is not as important as ensuring the state utility continues with the same trajectory that Brian Molefe started.This week, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown approved the board's recommendation to appoint Koko as the acting group CEO, saying he has a wealth of experience and understands Eskom s challenges.It comes after Molefe resigned last month following evidence of his relationship with the Gupta family and questionable deals made in the Public Protector's State of Capture report.Koko says he's been at Eskom for 21 years and worked with Molefe to ensure load shedding is a thing of the past. We re not talking about load shedding anymore, it s not in our vocabulary. Brian Molefe came in and stopped it and it s now in its proper capacity. I have work to do, I have no time to think about whether I need the job permanently or not.&quot; (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
