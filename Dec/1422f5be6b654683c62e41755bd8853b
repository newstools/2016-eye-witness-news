The stalwarts want the conference to discuss problems facing the ANC and to ultimately lead to the rebuilding and renewal of the party. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts have rejected the ANC's proposal for a consultative conference to be held two days before the policy conference next year. The veterans held a briefing in Johannesburg earlier on Tuesday following a meeting. The veterans have met with the ANC leaders three times already, leading to the party agreeing to their request for a consultative conference before the policy gathering next year. The stalwarts, who raised concerns about the state of the party, want the conference to discuss problems facing the organisation and ultimately lead to the rebuilding and renewal of the party.The ANC has already announced that it is willing to hold a consultative conference for the first two days of the policy gathering next year.But the veterans are not happy with the conference coinciding with the policy gathering. Struggle stalwart Wally Serote says: There has to be space between the national policy conference and the national consultative conference because the latter needs to do in-depth discussions about how we correct all the things that contributed to the crisis that the ANC finds itself now. They want six weeks to prepare the party's branches and meet with different sectors of society before the conference.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
