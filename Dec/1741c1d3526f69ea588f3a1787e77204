CAPE TOWN - Communications Minister Faith Muthambi is facing questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) on the state of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) as she testifies before the parliamentary inquiry into the board s fitness to hold office this afternoon.The committee conducting the hearings has already heard from a range of civil society organisations, including the Right2Know Campaign, Media Monitoring Africa and SOS Support Our Public Broadcaster.Follow day six of the SABC board inquiry here:On Tuesday, former company secretary Theresa Geldenhuys and board chairperson Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe were interrogated about their apparent failure to stop widespread wrongdoing at the public broadcaster.Maguvhe was unable to answer questions on major issues facing the SABC, including its controversial multimillion rand deal with MultiChoice, concerns raised by the Auditor-General and the fight by SABC journalists against censorship and political interference.The Democratic Alliance s Phumzile van Damme then questioned Maghuvhe. What on earth have you been doing as the chairperson of the SABC board and why on earth should we keep you on the board if you do not know any of the major issues facing the SABC? Why must the public continue to pay you a salary for that job?&quot;Maguvhe defended his performance and told MPs he d step down, but only when he receives a letter from President Jacob Zuma telling him to do so.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
