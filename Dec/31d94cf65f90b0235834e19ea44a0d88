The SACP says charges against McBride, Sibiya, O&#8217;Sullivan and Coetzee is evidence that state organs are being used. JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it is concerned that state security agencies are being used in to the African National Congress (ANC) infighting.The SACP says the security cluster should be concerned about South Africans instead of pursuing the political battles by members of the ANC.The communist party also says the charges against Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride, former Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya, private investigator Paul O Sullivan and crime intelligence officer Candice Coetzee is a clear evidence that state organs are being used to propagate narrow political end.Party spokesperson Alex Mashilo says, We must analyse the whole organisation of state organs afresh; and collectively identify the root of the political hand that manipulates these organs of state to fight inner party battles, to settle political scores and to target people who are critical of certain authorities. Mashilo also says the process in charging the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, which were later dropped was handled incompetently. Certainly something has to be done. The fact that this manipulation is clearly visible means that the cheques and balances that are in place are not efficient to prevent manipulation. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
