Gauteng Hawks head Prince Mokotedi says Robert McBride has been monitored since he received an intelligence report earlier this year. PRETORIA - Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride has downplayed claims by Gauteng Hawks head Prince Mokotedi that he s being monitored by three state agencies including crime intelligence and the State Security Agency. It emerged on Tuesday that Mokotedi has laid nine charges, including treason and conspiracy to commit murder against a group of people. He claims McBride was part of a group that met in December last year and again in March this year to discuss plans to start a popular revolt and have senior police officials assassinated. McBride has denied the allegations. Mokotedi says McBride and a group of people have been monitored since he received an intelligence report earlier this year. In between March and now, we have been monitoring activities of the particular group. Crime intelligence and SSA will talk for themselves but I also know they were monitoring the activities of that particular group. McBride says in a message to Eyewitness News that Mokotedi is trying hard to prop up his nonsensical narrative by claiming he received information from a source and that he s making up claims as he goes along. The State Security Agency says it doesn t discuss operational matters and further declined to say whether it would question Mokotedi for claiming that the agency was monitoring McBride and others.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
