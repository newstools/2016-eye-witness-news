JOHANNESBURG - The ad hoc parliamentary committee heard that the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) journalists who testified at the inquiry have received threatening text messages warning that blood will flow .The South African national Editors Forum (Sanef) has applauded the courage and commitment to ethical journalism shown by the SABC 8. Sanef chairperson Mahlatsi Gallens says: While the inquiry continues through December and January, proceedings thus far have shocked the nation and brought shame on the public broadcaster. Not only has editorial independence been trampled on, but so has the Broadcasting Act and Constitution. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
