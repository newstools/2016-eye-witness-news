Patrick Craven says whoever succeeds President Jacob Zuma should prioritise the plight of black workers. JOHANNESBURG The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says it doesn t believe Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will change the condition of workers should he become the country s next president, adding that the African National Congress (ANC) is no longer capable of leading, regardless of who is at the helm of the organisation. The union and its affiliates held a Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting on Wednesday ahead of its 10th national congress in Cape Town next Monday.The union s spokesperson Patrick Craven says, The ANC has become completely incapable of providing any kind of real lead, regardless of who leads it because we were one of the very first to call for President Zuma to resign because of the levels of corruption and looting of state resources. Craven says whoever succeeds Zuma should prioritise the plight of black workers. We do not believe simply replacing him with Cyril Ramaphosa will make any fundamental difference because we believe that the problems, which are sometimes referred to as state capture, are not confined to the Gupta family and a few politicians.
