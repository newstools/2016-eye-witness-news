JOHANNESBURG - The rand climbed as much as 1.3% against the dollar on Monday, mainly tracking a rally in commodity currencies driven by a firmer oil price.Stocks closed lower, with rand hedge companies with operations abroad coming under pressure from the stronger currency.The rand reached its strongest level for the day at 13.6150, the firmest it has been in a week. By 1614 GMT it was up 0.87% at 13.6800 compared with Friday's close.The rand took its cue from Latin American currencies which strengthened after OPEC and some other oil producers agreed to curb output, supporting appetite for commodity-linked assets.&quot;It seems like a general trend across emerging markets, particularly the commodity-centric currencies or countries,&quot; ETM market analyst Ricardo Da Camara said.&quot;The OPEC and non-OPEC agreement over the weekend has pushed up oil prices quite a bit and seems to be reflected now in general commodity-centric economies and their currencies.&quot;On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index fell 0.74% to 43,893 points while the All-Share index dropped 0.73% to 50,528 points.The major losers of the day were companies that reap the bulk of their revenue outside of South Africa and were therefore hurt by the firmer rand.&quot;It's putting some serious pressure on our rand hedges. British American Tobacco, Reinet, Richemont and all those heavy weights are coming off the back of a stronger rand,&quot; said BP Bernstein trader Vasili Tirasis.Reinet Investments fell 1.86% to R25.91, Richemont dropped 0.8% to R89.75 and British American Tobacco fell 1.05% to R84.99.Further losses were curbed by petrochemical company Sasol which rose 4.66% to R399.34 following a surge in the oil price.Trading was relatively slow, with nearly 223 million shares changing hands compared with last year's daily average of is 296 million.
