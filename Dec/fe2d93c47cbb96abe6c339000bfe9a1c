The SABC board inquiry has been disrupted again with the delegation staging a walkout from proceedings in Parliament. CAPE TOWN - Hlaudi Motsoeneng and rest of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) delegation has staged a walkout from ad hoc committee proceedings at Parliament.The committee deliberated whether to proceed or not earlier on Wednesday, after committee member Mbulaheni Maguvhe lodged an appeal against a Western Cape High Court ruling preventing him from halting the committee's work.#SABCinquiry Maguvhe&#39;s legal team objected he did not have PP&#39;s, AG&#39;s and ICASA report available in Braille-They abandoned proceedings.

A sluggish start for the inquiry into the SABC board's fitness to hold office, with the opening day marred by several adjournments.Committee Chairperson Vincent Smith ruled the day s proceedings will go ahead without the SABC delegation, but demanded outstanding reports requested of the board be made available. The non-presentation of the documents I requested earlier on is non-negotiable. This committee wants those documents and we ve instructed the legal team to go to the highest court in land if needs be. These reports include documents relating to Motsoeneng s most recent appointment and an SABC skills audit report.Opposition Members of Parliament have criticised Maguvhe s latest court bid as a desperate stalling tactic.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
