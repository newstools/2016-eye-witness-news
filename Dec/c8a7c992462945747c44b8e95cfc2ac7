A Reuters reporter then saw the police open fire on the crowd, which had continued to grow in size.Protests first broke out in early November in Bamenda when lawyers and teachers demanded better working conditions in a rare act of defiance against President Paul Biya, 83, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982.Some demonstrators were armed with steel bars and stones, said one police official, adding that officers had acted in self-defence. One police officer was wounded in the unrest, he said. Some of our elements were surrounded by thugs, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to reporters. They had come to kill.
