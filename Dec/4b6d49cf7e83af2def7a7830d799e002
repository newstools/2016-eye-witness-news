The SACP leader says his party will not defend any attempts to capture the state by the likes of the Gupta &amp; Rupert families. JOHANNESBURG South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Solly Mapaila says his party will not defend any attempts to capture the state by corporates or the likes of the Gupta and Rupert families.Mapaila was speaking at the African National Congress (ANC) s memorial service for late Cuban President Fidel Castro at the Johannesburg City Hall on Wednesday. He says like Castro, the SACP wants an independent and sovereign state.Mapaila says he is disappointed that South Africa only sent the president to honour struggle hero Castro while the Cubans worked hard to assist the country in attaining its freedom.He says this is a sign of how detached the country is from the revolution. If you allow the corporates to capture your state, you are not actually defending national sovereignty. I reasserted the fact that we in the Communist Party are clear about the fact that we do not buy anyone of the corporates, whether it s the Ruperts or Guptas. We don t want them. Mapaila says the ANC cannot speak about defending the revolution while it can t even build street committees.The SACP leader received a resounding applause with every sentence.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
