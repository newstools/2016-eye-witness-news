JOHANNESBURG - The controversial and well-known graphic artist Ayanda Mabulu has published another drawing showing President Jacob Zuma s private parts hanging out and being dragged away in a recycling trolley.Mabulu, who is known for President Zuma s painting known as Spear Down My Throat (The Pornography of Power) , says the painting shows that Zuma belongs in a rubbish bin as he has failed the country.His paintings are currently on exhibition at Maboneng in Johannesburg.He says his paintings are mainly focusing on the state of the country. In the painting he is being dragged in a rubbish trolley to be thrown in the rubbish dump by a man who recycles rubbish in the city. So if I had power, I would have done that.
