Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has agreed to stay in power until the country&#8217;s annual budget is passed in the coming days.

Renzi has agreed to stay in power until the country s annual budget is passed in the coming days.

They are opposed to the Eurozone but not the EU itself, views likely to cause sleepless nights ahead for some EU leaders.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
