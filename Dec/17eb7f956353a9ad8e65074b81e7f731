The Basic Education Minister has likened the country&#8217;s maths education to a patient that is in ICU and receiving treatment. JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has called for an overhaul of South Africa s methods and practices of teaching maths in order to address the dismal performance of pupils.Motshekga has joined experts and role-players in the education sector for a three-day maths indaba in Pretoria. She has likened the country s maths education to a patient that s in ICU and receiving treatment. It is responding, it was in ICU and it's coming out. Motshekga says while the department is working towards improving the teaching of maths, parents also have a role to play. The kids who play with educational toys - Lego, puzzles - perform much better whilst they are still young. The minister says the country urgently needs to create its own unique way of teaching maths to demystify the belief that South African children are not mathematically inclined.(Edited by Neo Koza)
