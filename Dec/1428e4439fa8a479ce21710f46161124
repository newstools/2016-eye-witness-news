Attempts at getting back level were in vain for Sundowns and their defence was again breached resulting in a 2-0 score. JOHANNESBURG - Much was expected from African Champion Mamelodi Sundowns as they got their Fifa Club World Cup campaign against host club Kashima Antlers of Japan, a side that had already been in action, beating New Zealand outfit Auckland City on Thursday. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane would have been happy with how his side asserted themselves in the opening half, Khama Billiat at the heart of everything good from the Brazilians. However, on a number of occasions, his industry wasn t complimented his fellow attackers as the South African side saw a number of good chances go untaken in the first half.Khashima meanwhile were the better side in the opening 15 minutes of the second half, and had Dennis Onyango and his defence scrambling to keep the scores level, Wayne Arendse on call to clear off the line just before the hour mark. He couldn t do anything about the opener though as Yasushi Endo fired the hosts into the lead with a goal that Onyango will feel he should have done better to keep out. Attempts at getting back level were in vain for Sundowns and their defence was again breached late in the game by Mu Kanazaki. Two-nil the final score in Osaka. Sundowns will on Wednesday face South Korean outfit Jeonbuk Hyundai in a play-off for 5th place.
