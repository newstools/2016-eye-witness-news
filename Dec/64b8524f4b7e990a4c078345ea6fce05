Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko is appearing before the police portfolio committee to clarify some issues. CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko is appearing before the police portfolio committee on Wednesday to clarify some issues facing the South African Police Service (SAPS).Some Members of Parliament (MPs) have raised questions over a R30 million tender he allegedly awarded to his girlfriend, as well as about reports involving Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert Mcbride.In his opening, however, Nhleko said he would not be answering questions on Ipid issues.He says the committee must call him to specifically discuss the directorate. We wouldn t want to deal with that issue outside of the directives of Parliament. For example, there s this particular process that has got to be started. We feel that any other discussion outside of that designated practice borders on unfair labour practices. But committee member Zakhele Mbhele says Nhleko was told that he would have to answer Ipid questions today. As far as I know that is what this meeting was for. It is in the committee list. A briefing by the minister of police on matters in the public domain regarding SAPS and Ipid leadership. The matter of whether or not is being referred to the committee for an inquiry is neither here nor there. There s no subjudicate principle to evoke here. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
