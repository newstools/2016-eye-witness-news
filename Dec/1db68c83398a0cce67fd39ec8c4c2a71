Bonginkosi Madikizela says R10 billion is also being injected into revamping informal settlements in Cape Town. CAPE TOWN Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela says the department is changing the criteria for free housing.Madikizela says the department wants to prioritise the neediest in communities, like people who have been on waiting lists for more than two decades.He says R10 billion is also being injected into revamping informal settlements in Cape Town.Madikizela says the department needs to refocus the way in which it provides free housing due to limited resources and high population growth. The current trend that is very disturbing is people who ve been waiting for years are forgotten and those who are prepared to be vocal and break the law are the ones being prioritised, and we can t continue like that. Madikizela says they want to ensure the neediest people, such as the elderly and disabled, get first preference. We must make sure that those people who have been waiting for 20 years have been accommodated. He says the department will also consider certain cases where people are evicted from private property, such as Woodstock s Bromwell Street families who are facing eviction.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
