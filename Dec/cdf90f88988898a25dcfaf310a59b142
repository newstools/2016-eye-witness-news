Struggle stalwarts are expected to meet with the party to discuss the resolution around the consultative conference. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwarts are expected to meet with the party on Thursday to discuss the resolution around the consultative conference.It s understood calls made during the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, for President Jacob Zuma to step down, will also be on the agenda.On Tuesday, the party s NEC announced it would dedicate two days of its policy conference next year to look at the state of the organisation.The veterans have met with the party s national working committee (NWC) twice already.One of resolutions taken during the meeting was to stop public criticism of each other.This decision came after some veterans called on Zuma to step down. The president retaliated by reprimanding them, even going as far as questioning the stalwarts membership and loyalty to the ANC.Another resolution was around the request for a consultative conference which the party has agreed to.But since then, developments around calls for the president to step down by his colleagues in the NEC surfaced.The ANC also said the call for Zuma to leave office didn t receive sufficient support, and was rejected.Some veterans who have spoken to Eyewitness News say they want recent developments to be included in discussions on Thursday.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
