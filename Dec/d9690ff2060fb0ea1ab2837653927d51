The students from Wits and the University of Johannesburg started the trip to Port Elizabeth on 1 December. JOHANNESBURG - A group of Gauteng students have reached the Eastern Cape province in a 1,000 kilometre walk from Johannesburg. The students from Wits and the University of Johannesburg aim to raise funds towards the education of thousands of university students. They started the trip to Port Elizabeth on 1 December and plan to reach their destination before Christmas Day. After being exposed to what they have described as brown and dead landscapes over the past ten days, the group has detailed the experience in a statement. The Eastern Cape just exhibited a different feeling that we never felt when walking through the Free State. Seeing the Orange River and the bridge made us calm, some sort of a cathartic feeling. It felt as if we had just rebooted. The images below were captured en route to Steynsburg. They have urged South Africans to continue donating to the cause. We have come to realise that truck drivers are the friendliest people on the road. The cheering we get from them is what keeps us going. Some even stopped in front of us today, they applauded us and then donated R40 towards the cause. We are highly grateful for that. It isn't about how much they donate, but it is that they have recognised our cause. It really is a great feeling. All proceeds generated through the project will go directly to the national bursary organisation Study Trust. WATCH: Feet4Fees a step towards helping students with 2017 fees
