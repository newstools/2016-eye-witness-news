The former SABC executive says he found several problems within the board, including lack of cohesiveness and lack of knowledge of the business. CAPE TOWN - A former top South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) executive is warning that the broadcaster runs the risk of becoming a completely unviable business.Former risk and governance group executive Itani Tseisi has told the parliamentary inquiry investigating the SABC board that the financial situation at the public broadcaster worried him.Tseisi says he found several problems within the board, including a lack of cohesiveness and a lack of knowledge of SABC business.Members of Parliament have heard the SABC could be in deeper financial trouble than previously suspected and could not be expected to make a profit in the foreseeable future.Tseisi replied yes , when committee chairperson Vincent Smith asked him: As a risk practitioner, you alluded the SABC for the foreseeable future will not be making a profit. Are you saying to this committee that the concept of a going concern is a real threat to the SABC, yes or no? This comes despite assurances from head of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng and other SABC representatives during a media briefing on Wednesday, that they have the financial situation under control.Tseisi, however, says this is not the case. It is my view that there s been systematic destruction of the governance within the organisation. The committee will reconvene on Monday to continue the inquiry.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
