JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Health Department says its forensic pathology facilities are fully operational again after disruptions to the services due to a strike by some workers.Last week forensic officers at mortuaries across the province went on an illegal strike over salaries and employment conditions.Grieving families complained that the bodies of their loved ones were not be released in time for funerals.The department was then granted a court interdict on Saturday blocking further protests.Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu says workers have now all returned to their posts. Their complaints are genuine but they are not a provincial issue, they need to be taken through the bargaining council. They relate to the occupational specific dispensation and the grading therefore and I think it affects about seven provinces. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
