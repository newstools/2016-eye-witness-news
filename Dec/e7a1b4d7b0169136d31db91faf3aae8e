The bill was adopted last week after hearings into unauthorised spending at some provincial government departments. JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng Legislature's standing committee on public accounts says the newly adopted Unauthorised Expenditure Bill will see Provincial Treasury pump R1.8 billion into some departments which have persistently exceeded their budgets. The committee adopted the bill last week after holding hearings into unauthorised spending at some provincial government departments.Committee chairperson Mbongeni Radebe says the Health and Education departments are prone to unauthorised expenditure due to unexpected and increased emergency medical service transfers, overcrowding in hospitals and the migration of pupils among other unexpected costs.Speaking to Eyewitness News, Radebe said the bill would mean Provincial Treasury has to assist some departments by paying off historic unauthorised expenditure over a period between 2004 and 2014. Approved with funding it s about R1.8 billion. Radebe, however, says not all departments have given satisfactory reasons for their unauthorised debt and unauthorised expenditure amounting to R8.9 million. The reasons that were given to us for the amount were good enough but not good enough as well, so that s why we approved that the unauthorised was unjustified but we said it must be funded from their own budget as the department. Radebe says the R1.8 billion from Treasury will have a positive impact on service delivery.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
