The DA says Parliament was bypassed when the executive made the decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has dismissed government s claim that Parliament was not bypassed when the executive made the decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court.The party says seeking parliamentary approval was an afterthought.The DA has asked the High Court in Pretoria to declare the decision unconstitutional.The DA says the executive does not have the authority to make the decision, because such matter should have first been discussed in Parliament. Advocate for government Jeremy Gauntlet told the court that Parliament has not been bypassed and referred to several motions including one to repeal the Implementation Act.But advocate for the DA, Stephen Budlender says parliamentary approval was only sought after the party lodged its application. What is communicated to Parliament is that a notice of withdrawal has been submitted, that it will take effect a year from now and most critically in this letter to Parliament itself there s been no suggestion that this has to be approved by parliament. It s only on 3 November, that for the first time Parliament approved this form. Judgment has been reserved.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
