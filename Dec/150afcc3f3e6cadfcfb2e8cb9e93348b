The Democratic Alliance on Wednesday presented its 2016 Gauteng Cabinet score cards at the Provincial Legislature. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has given Premier David Makhura five out of 10, saying he s a man of charisma and not action.The party presented its 2016 Gauteng Cabinet score cards at the Provincial Legislature earlier on Wednesday.The party says it identified Makhura s failure to fire Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu after the deaths of 37 mentally ill patients in the province as one of his blunders.DA Gauteng leader John Moody has also pointed to inequality and social ills such as the housing backlog and violent crimes, which he says are on the rise in the province. This was one of the premier s main focal points in his inauguration speech, that he will not allow corruption to go unchallenged. Yet, two and a half years later, very little has been done in that regard. (Edited by Tamsin Wort)
