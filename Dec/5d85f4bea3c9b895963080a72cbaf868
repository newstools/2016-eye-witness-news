CAPE TOWN - Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board member Vusi Mavuso says basic corporate governance practices were flouted during his tenure at the public broadcaster.Mavuso testified in Parliament's SABC ad hoc committee on Thursday afternoon.The committee was tasked by Parliament to probe the corporation's board.In her report, When Governance and Ethics Fail, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found that then COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng lied about his qualifications and unlawfully awarded himself salary increases.Mavuso says he submitted his resignation at a time when it became unbearable to be associated with the broadcaster. I d be against some of the decisions that were taken, particularly those involving court cases. There were a number of decisions that were taken via round robin. I would not approve of those. Invariably you ll see a litigation taking place, giving an impression that it was a unanimous decision. The ad hoc committee says it will summons board chair Mbulaheni Maguvhe to appear on Tuesday, after he failed to attend Thursday afternoon's proceedings.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
