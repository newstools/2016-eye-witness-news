Ben Swart from Pretoria was paddling with two friends in Plett when he was knocked off his surf ski by a shark. CAPE TOWN - A paddler who survived a shark encounter in Plettenberg Bay says his lucky escape was all down to the shark losing interest.Ben Swart from Pretoria was paddling with two friends when he was knocked off his surf ski.That's when the shark apparently breached and took a bite out of the lightweight vessel. The shark didn t attack me it attacked the surf ski. They say it was a case of mistaken identity. I think what saved our bacon was that there was no blood in the water. It was a bloodless affair.
