The Energy Department has announced Eskom will fulfil the role of the procurement agency for the nuclear program going forward. CAPE TOWN - The Department of Energy has announced Eskom will fulfil the role of the procurement agency for the nuclear program going forward.This was revealed during proceedings at the Western Cape High Court earlier on Tuesday.Environmental groups Southern African Faith Communities' Environment Institute (SAFCEI) and Earthlife Africa are legally challenging government's proposed nuclear procurement programme.SAFCEI's Kumi Naidoo says there are elements pushing for this nuclear deal to go ahead. This delay we ve seen in court is a pattern of evasion not willing to account for the nonsensical nature of this decision to proceed with this nuclear procurement. The lobby groups have called for the procurement process to be halted until the court case has been finalized.But the judge has ruled that Eskom may go ahead with the procurement process, saying it does not strike it as something that can be rushed through.The hearing will resume early next year.
