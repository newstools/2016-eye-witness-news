JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng says while it believes provincial MEC Panyaza Lesufi has performed better than other MECs, he s failed to deal with basic challenges facing his department like providing running water, electricity and sanitation.The party gave Lesufi one of the highest scores of 6 out of 10 for his swift response to challenges in his own department.The DA presented its 2016 Gauteng cabinet score cards at the Provincial Legislature on Wednesday.Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo also received 6 out of 10 and the rest received lower scores. Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu received 0 out of 10, Premier David Makhura scored a 5 and Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile had 3 out of 10.DA Gauteng leader John Moodley says while Lesufi did well with the piloting of the online school enrollment process, he also had some failures. His failure to comply with the national department s norms to reduce the cost of building new schools hampers the department s budget. He also failed to take a lead on the cash for jobs case, in which Sadtu members have been implicated. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
