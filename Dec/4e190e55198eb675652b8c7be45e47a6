CAPE TOWN - At least eight people, including three children, have drowned in the Western Cape since last weekend.In the latest incident a woman and a 14-year-old girl drowned in Strand on Thursday.A 16-year-old girl was also rescued at the same beach after suffering an asthma attack while in the water.The National Sea Rescue Institute s (NSRI) Craig Lambinon has warned beachgoers to be vigilant of dangerous rip currents. More people are going into water and rip currents are very strong. The conditions at Strand Beach weren t ideal and you need to make sure that you check out weather conditions, like where the high tides and low tides are. Lambinon adds people should familiarise themselves about the dangers of rip currents. Don t swim alone, rather swim with a friend or with responsible adult supervision for children. We are urging people to find out as much as possible before going to a beach and only go to beaches where lifeguards are on duty. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
