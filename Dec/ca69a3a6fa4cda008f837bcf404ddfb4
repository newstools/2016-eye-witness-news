CAPE TOWN - A fresh storm is brewing over the SABC after documents released by a whistle-blower reveal how a multi-million rand contract between the public broadcaster and a company called Vision View was allegedly concluded outside all governance processes.Eyewitness News is in possession of documents that suggest a legitimate tender for refurbishing studios was abruptly cancelled and awarded to Vision View.It s alleged finance and technology managers who objected to the process or attempted to bring the procurement irregularities to the board s attention were suspended.The initial tender process to supply equipment for studios at the SABC was allegedly abruptly halted by the then COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng in February 2015.This can only be done by the board. According to the documents, it was a collusive move aimed at paving the way for a tender deal with a company called Vision View worth more nearly R40 million.The Vision View deal was initially agreed upon by the Group Exco. But this was before it was ratified by the either Exco or the Board.A source claims that a letter of appointment was issued to Vision View three days before the Exco meeting took place.It s understood the executive committee had decided to not go ahead with the deal until certain requirement were met, which according to the documents, it never did.Attempts by EWN to get comment from both the SABC and Vision View have so far been unsuccessful.
