Government&#8217;s energy plan is for the provision of adequate electricity to meet demand for the next 20 to 40 years. JOHANNESBURG Civil action group Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has written to Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson objecting to the integrated resource plan for electricity, saying that it is flawed.Government s energy plan is for the provision of adequate electricity to meet demand for the next 20 to 40 years, but appears to be biased towards nuclear, according to Outa and energy expert Chris Yelland.Outa s Ted Blom says the plan is flawed for two reasons the first being procedural. They haven t granted the public adequate time to assimilate the document and its contents. It s quite a lot of pages. Secondly, we believe that the base case and the scenarios that have been run have been biased and not objectively set. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
