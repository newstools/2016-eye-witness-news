Ipid head Robert McBride had challenged Gauteng Hawks boss Major General Prince Mokotedi to a lie detector test. JOHANNESBURG Independent Investigative Police Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride says he would have loved for the Gauteng Hawks boss, Major General Prince Mokotedi, to also undergo the polygraph so that the truth can come out.On Saturday McBride passed a lie detector test confirming he was being truthful when he denied any knowledge of Mokotedi s allegations.The Hawks head had opened charges of treason, espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, corruption, intimidation and harassment, defeating the ends of justice and tax evasion against McBride.After initially agreeing to do the polygraph, the Hawks boss pulled out, saying he was advised his participation will not serve any legal purpose and would unsettle the network of sources and informers.Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini says: He wanted the truth to come out but he knew because of the fabrication that there was never any intention on General Mokotedi s part to participate in this. He just said it obviously because the cameras and news was on him. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
